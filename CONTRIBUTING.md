2. click on the file you want to edit or click *Add File*
3. make your changes to the file or upload you file
4. click *Propose changes* or *Propose new file*
5. click *Create pull request*
6. explain your contribution in the text field
7. click *Create pull request*
8. wait for you changes to be merged into MTEX development branch

## The consistent way for bigger changes

1. fork the MTEX repository to your personal GitHub account
2. clone it on your local computer
3. apply your changes
4. push your changes to your personal GitHub account
