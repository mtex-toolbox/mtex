%% Data import and grain detection
%
% Lets import some Magnesium data that are full of grains and segment grain
% within the data set.

% load some example data
mtexdata twins

% segment grains
[grains,ebsd.grainId,ebsd.mis2mean] = calcGrains(ebsd('indexed'))

% smooth them
grains = grains.smooth

% visualize the grains
plot(grains,grains.meanOrientation)

% store crystal symmetry of Magnesium
CS = grains.CS

%%
% Now we can extract from the grains its boundary and save it to a seperate
% variable

gB = grains.boundary

%%
% The output tells us that we have 3219 Magnesium to Magnesium boundary
% segments and 606 boundary segements where the grains are cutted by the
% scanning boundary. To restrict the grain boundaries to a specific phase
% transistion you shall do

gB_MgMg = gB('Magnesium','Magnesium')

%% Properties of grain boundaries
%
% A variable of type grain boundary contains the following properties
%
% * misorientation
% * direction
% * segLength
%
% These can be used to colorize the grain boundaries. By the following
% command we plot the grain boundaries colorized by the misorientation
% angle

plot(gB_MgMg,gB_MgMg.misorientation.angle./degree,'linewidth',2)
mtexColorbar

%%
% We observe many grain boundaries with a large misorientation angle of
% about 86 degree. Those grain boundaries are most likely twin boundaries.
% To detect them more precisely we define first the twinning as a
% misorientation, which is reported in literature by  (1,1,-2,0) parallel
% to (2,-1,-1,0) and (-1,0,1,1) parallel to (1,0,-1,1). In MTEX it is
% defined by

twinning = orientation('map',Miller(1,1,-2,0,CS),Miller(2,-1,-1,0,CS),...
  Miller(-1,0,1,1,CS),Miller(1,0,-1,1,CS))

%%
% The followin lines show that the twinning is actually a rotation about
% axis (-2110) and angle 86.3 degree

% the rotational axis
round(twinning.axis)

% the rotational angle
twinning.angle / degree

%%
% Next we check for each boundary segment whether it is a twinning boundary,
% i.e., whether boundary misorientation is close to the twinning.

% restrict to twinnings with threshold 5 degree
isTwinning = angle(gB_MgMg.misorientation,twinning) < 5*degree;
twinBoundary = gB_MgMg(isTwinning)

% plot the twinning boundaries
plot(grains,grains.meanOrientation)
hold on
plot(twinBoundary,'linecolor','b','linewidth',2,'displayName','twin boundary')
hold off

%% Merge twins along twin boundaries
% Grains that have a common twin boundary are assumed to inherite
% from one common grain. To reconstruct those inital grains we merge grains
% together which have a common twin boundary. This is done by the command
% <grain2d.merge.html merge>. 

[mergedGrains,parentId] = merge(grains,twinBoundary);

% plot the merged grains
%plot(ebsd,ebsd.orientations)
hold on
plot(mergedGrains.boundary,'linecolor','k','linewidth',2.5,'linestyle','-',...
  'displayName','merged grains')
hold off

%% Grain relationships
% The second output argument |paraentId| of <grain2d.merge.html merge> is a
% list with the same size as grains which indicates for each grains into
% which common grain it has been merged. The id of the commong grain is
% usually different from the ids of the merged grains and can be found by

mergedGrains(16).id

%%
% Hence, we can find all childs of common grain 16 by 

childs = grains(parentId == mergedGrains(16).id)

%% Calculate the twinned area
% We can also answer the question about the relative area of these
% initial grains that have undergone twinning to total area.

twinId = unique(gB_MgMg(isTwinning).grainId);

% compute the area fraction
sum(area(grains(twinId))) / sum(area(grains)) * 100

%% Setting Up the EBSD Data for the Merged Grains
% Note that the Id's of the merged grains does not fit to the grainIds
% stored in the initial ebsd variable. As a consequence, the following
% command will not give the right result

plot(mergedGrains(16).boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold on
plot(ebsd(mergedGrains(16)),ebsd(mergedGrains(16)).orientations)
hold off

%%
% In order to update the grainId in the ebsd variable to the merged grains
% we proceed as follows.

% copy ebsd data into a new variable to not change the old data
ebsd_merged = ebsd;

% update the grainIds to the parentIds
ebsd_merged('indexed').grainId = parentId(ebsd('indexed').grainId)

%%
% Now the variable |ebsd_merged| can be indexed by the merged grains, i.e.

plot(ebsd_merged(mergedGrains(16)),ebsd_merged(mergedGrains(16)).orientations)
hold on
plot(mergedGrains(16).boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off
