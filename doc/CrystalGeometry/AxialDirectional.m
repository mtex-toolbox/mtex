%% Antipodal Symmetry
% MTEX allows to identify antipodal directions to model axes and to
% identify misorientations with oposite rotational angle. The later is
% required when working with misorientations between grains of the same
% phase and the order of the grains is arbitrary.

%% Directions vs. Axes
%
% In MTEX it is possible to consider three dimensional vectors either as
% directions or as axes. The key option to distinguish between both
% interpretations is *antipodal*.
%
% Consider a pair of vectors

v1 = vector3d(1,1,2);
v2 = vector3d(1,1,-2);

%%
% and plots them in a spherical projection

plot([v1,v2],'label',{'v_1','v_2'})

%%
% These vectors will appear either on the upper or on the lower hemisphere.
% In order to treat these vectors as axes, i.e. in order to assume
% antipodal symmetry - one has to use the keyword *antipodal*.

plot([v1,v2],'label',{'v_1','v_2'},'antipodal')

%%
% Now the direction |v_2| is identified with the direction |-v_2| which
% plots at the upper hemisphere.

%% The Angle between Directions and Axes
%
% Another example, where antipodal symmetry matters is the angle between
% two vectors. In the absence of antipodal geometry we have

angle(v1,v2) / degree

%%
% whereas, if antipodal symmetry is assumed we obtain

angle(v1,v2,'antipodal') / degree

%% Antipodal Symmetry in Experimental Pole Figures
%
% Due to Friedel's law experimental pole figures always provide antipodal
% symmetry. One consequence of this fact is that MTEX plots pole figure
% data always on the upper hemisphere. Moreover if you annotate a certain
% direction to pole figure data, it is always interpreted as an axis, i.e.
% projected to the upper hemisphere if necessary

mtexdata dubna

% plot the first pole figure
plot(pf({1}))

% annotate a axis on the souther hemisphere
annotate(vector3d(1,0,-1),'labeled','backgroundColor','w')

%% Antipodal Symmetry in Recalculated Pole Figures
%
% However, in the case of pole figures calculated from an ODF antipodal
% symmetry is in general not present.

% some prefered orientation
o = orientation('Euler',20*degree,30*degree,0,'ZYZ',CS);

% define an unimodal ODF
odf = unimodalODF(o);

% plot pole figures
plotPDF(odf,[Miller(1,2,2,CS),-Miller(1,2,2,CS)])

%%
% Hence, if one wants to compare calculated pole figures with experimental
% ones, one has to add antipodal symmetry.

plotPDF(odf,Miller(1,2,2,CS),'antipodal')

%% Antipodal Symmetry in Inverse Pole Figures
%
% The same reasoning as above holds true for inverse pole figures. If we
% look at complete, inverse pole figures they do not posses antipodal symmetry
% in general

plotIPDF(odf,[yvector,-yvector],'complete')

%%
% However, if we add the keyword antipodal, antipodal symmetry is enforced.

plotIPDF(odf,yvector,'antipodal','complete')

%%
% Notice how MTEX, automatically reduces the fundamental region of inverse
% pole figures in the case that antipodal symmetry is present.

plotIPDF(odf,yvector)

%%
plotIPDF(odf,yvector,'antipodal')


%% EBSD Colocoding
%
% Antipodal symmetry effects also the colocoding of ebsd plots. Let's first
% import some data.

mtexdata forsterite

%%
% Now we plot these data with a colorcoding according to the inverse
% (1,0,0) pole figure. If we use the Laue group for inverse pole figure
% color coding we add antipodal symmetry to the inverse pole figure

oM = ipdfHSVOrientationMapping(ebsd('fo').CS.Laue);

% the colorcode
plot(oM)

%%
% Here the colorized data

plot(ebsd('fo'),oM.orientation2color(ebsd('fo').orientations))


%%
% If we use the point group of proper rotations this antipodal symmetry is
% not present and a larger region of the inverse pole figure is colorized

oM = ipdfHSVOrientationMapping(ebsd('fo').CS.properGroup);

% the colorcode
plot(oM)

%%
% Here the colorized data

plot(ebsd('fo'),oM.orientation2color(ebsd('fo').orientations))
