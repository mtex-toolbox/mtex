% Crystal Shapes are used to visualize crystal orientations, twinning or
% lattice planes.
%
%% Simple crystal shapes
%
% In the case of cubic or hexagonal materials the corresponding crystal are
% often represented as cubes or hexagons, where the faces correspond to the
% lattice planes {100} in the cubic case and {1,0,-1,0},{0,0,0,1} in the
% hexagonal case. Such simple crystal shapes may be created in MTEX with
% the commands

% import some hexagonal data
mtexdata titanium;

% define a simple hexagonal crystal shape
cS = crystalShape.hex(ebsd.CS)

% and plot it
close all
plot(cS,'faceAlpha',0.2)

%% 
% Internally, a crystal shape is represented as a list of faces which are
% bounded by a list of vertices |cS.V| and edges |cS.E|

cS.V

%%
% Using the commands <crystalShape.plotInnerFace.html |plotInnerFace|>,
% <crystalShape.plotSlipSystem.html |plot(cS,sS)|> and <arrow3d.html
% |arrow3d|> we may plot internal lattice planes, directions or slip
% systems into the crystal shape

sS = [slipSystem.pyramidal2CA(ebsd.CS), ...
  slipSystem.pyramidalA(ebsd.CS)]

plot(cS,'faceAlpha',0.2)
hold on
plot(cS,sS(2),'faceColor','blue')
plot(cS,sS(1),'faceColor','red')

%% Calculating with crystal shapes
% Crystal shapes are defined in crystal coordinates. Thus applying an
% orientation rotates them into specimen coordinates. This functionality
% can be used to visualize crystal orientations in EBSD maps

% plot an EBSD map
clf % clear current figure
plot(ebsd,ebsd.orientations)

hold on
scaling = 100; % scale the crystal shape to have a nice size

% plot at position (500,500) the orientation of the corresponding crystal
plot(500,500,50, ebsd(500,500).orientations * cS * scaling)
hold off


%%
% As we have seen in the previous section we can apply several operations
% on crystal shapes. These include
% 
% * |factor * cS| scales the crystal shape in size
% * |ori * cS| rotates the crystal shape in the defined orientation
% * |[xy] + cS| or |[xyz] + cS| shifts the crystal shape in the specified
% positions
%
% At this point it comes into help that MTEX supports lists of crystal
% shapes, i.e., whenever one of the operations listed above includes a
% list (e.g. a list of orientations) the multiplication will yield a list
% of crystal shapes. Lets illustrate this

% compute some grains
grains = calcGrains(ebsd);
grains = smooth(grains,5);

% and plot them
plot(grains,grains.meanOrientation)

% find the big ones
isBig = grains.grainSize>50;

% define a list of crystal shape that is oriented as the grain mean
% orientation and scaled according to the grain area
cSGrains = grains(isBig).meanOrientation * cS * 0.7 * sqrt(grains(isBig).area);

% now we can plot these crystal shapes at the grain centers
hold on
plot(grains(isBig).centroid + cSGrains)
hold off

%% Plotting crystal shapes
% The above can be accomplished a bit more directly and a bit more nice
% with

% plot a grain map
plot(grains,grains.meanOrientation)

% and on top for each large grain a crystal shape
hold on
plot(grains(isBig),0.7*cS,'FaceColor','none','linewidth',2)
hold off

%%
% In the same way we may visualize grain orientations and grains size
% within pole figures

plotPDF(grains(isBig).meanOrientation,Miller({1,0,-1,0},{0,0,0,1},ebsd.CS),'contour')
plot(grains(isBig).meanOrientation,0.002*cSGrains,'add2all')

%%
% or even within ODF sections

% compute the odf 
odf = calcDensity(ebsd.orientations);

% plot the odf in sigma sections
plotSection(odf,'sigma','contour')

% and on top of it the crystal shapes
plot(grains(isBig).meanOrientation,0.002*cSGrains,'add2all')

%% Twinning relationships
% We may also you crystal shapes to illustrate twinning relation ships

% define some twinning misorientation
mori = orientation.byAxisAngle(Miller({1 0-1 0},ebsd.CS),34.9*degree)

% plot the crystal in ideal orientation
close all
plot(cS,'FaceAlpha',0.5)
 
% and on top of it in twinning orientation
hold on
plot(mori * cS *0.9,'FaceColor','orange')
hold off

%% Defining complicated crystal shapes
%
% For symmetries other then hexagonal or cubic one would like to have
% more complicated crystal shape representing the true appearance. To this
% end one has to include more faces into the representation and carefuly
% adjust their distance to the origin.
%
%% 
% Lets consider a quartz crystal. 

cs = loadCIF('quartz')

%%
% Its shape is mainly bounded by the following faces

m = Miller({1,0,-1,0},cs);  % hexagonal prism
r = Miller({1,0,-1,1},cs);  % positive rhomboedron, usally bigger then z
z = Miller({0,1,-1,1},cs);  % negative rhomboedron
s1 = Miller({2,-1,-1,1},cs);% left tridiagonal bipyramid
s2 = Miller({1,1,-2,1},cs); % right tridiagonal bipyramid
x1 = Miller({6,-1,-5,1},cs);% left positive Trapezohedron
x2 = Miller({5,1,-6,1},cs); % right positive Trapezohedron

%%
% If we take only the first three faces we end up with

N = [m,r,z];
cS = crystalShape(N)

plot(cS)

%%
% i.e. we see only  the possitive and negative rhomboedrons, but the
% hexagonal prism are to far away from the origin to cut the shape. We may
% decrease the distance, by multiplying the coresponding normal with a
% factor larger then 1.

N = [2*m,r,z];

cS = crystalShape(N);
plot(cS)

%%
% Next in a typical Quartz crystal the negativ rhomboedron is a bit smaller
% then the positiv rhomboedron. Lets correct for this.

% collect the face normal with the right scalling
N = [2*m,r,0.9*z];

cS = crystalShape(N);
plot(cS)

%%
% Finaly, we add the tridiagonal bipyramid and the positive Trapezohedron

% collect the face normal with the right scalling
N = [2*m,r,0.9*z,0.7*s1,0.3*x1];

cS = crystalShape(N);
plot(cS)

%% Marking crystal faces
% We may colorize the faces according to their lattice planes using the
% command

plot(cS,'colored')

%%
% or even label the faces directly

plot(cS)
N = unique(cS.N.symmetrise,'noSymmetry','stable');
fC = cS.faceCenter;

for i = 1:length(N)
  text3(fC(i),char(round(N(i)),'latex'),'scaling',1.1,'interpreter','latex')
end



%% Defining complicated crystals more simple
% We see that defining a complicated crystal shape is a tedious work. To
% this end MTEX allows to model the shape with a habitus and a extension
% parameter. This approach has been developed by J. Enderlein in
% <https://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/Articles/3279 A package for
% displaying crystal morphology. Mathematica Journal, 7(1), 1997>. The two
% parameters are used to model the distance of a face from the origin.
% Setting all parameters to one we obtain

% take the face normals unscaled
N = [m,r,z,s2,x2];

habitus = 1;
extension = [1 1 1];
cS = crystalShape(N,habitus,extension);
plot(cS,'colored')


%%
% The scale parameter models the inverse extension of the crystal in each
% dimension. In order to make the crystal a bit longer and the negative
% rhomboedrons smaller we could do

extension = [0.9 1.1 1];
cS = crystalShape(N,habitus,extension);
plot(cS,'colored')

%%
% Next the habitus parameter describes how close faces with mixed hkl are
% to the origin. If we increase the habitus parameter the trapezohedron and
% the bipyramid become more and more dominant

habitus = 1.1;
cS = crystalShape(N,habitus,extension);
plot(cS,'colored'), snapnow

habitus = 1.2;
cS = crystalShape(N,habitus,extension);
plot(cS,'colored'), snapnow

habitus = 1.3;
cS = crystalShape(N,habitus,extension);
plot(cS,'colored')

%% Select faces
% A specific face of the crystal shape may be selected by its normal vector
