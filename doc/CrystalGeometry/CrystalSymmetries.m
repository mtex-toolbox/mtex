%% Crystal Symmetries
% 
% Crystal symmetries are a sets of rotations and mirroring operations that
% leave the lattice of a crystal invariant. They form so called groups
% since the concatenation of two symmetry operations is again a symmetry
% operation. 
%
% Depending which symmetry operations are coonsidered the symmetry groups
% are categorized either into 230 space groups, 32 point groups or 11 Laue
% groups.
% 
%% Purely enatiomorphic (rotational) symmetry groups
%
% There exist exactly 11 symmetry groups consisting of proper rotations
% only, namely, 1, 2, 222, 3, 23, 4, 422, 6, 622, 32, 432. These are the so
% called enatiomorphic groups. All the groups can be defined in MTEX either
% by its international notation

cs = crystalSymmetry('432')

%%
% or by the Schoenflies notation

cs = crystalSymmetry('O')

plot(cs)

%% Laue groups
%
% For any symmetry group we obtain the corresponding Laue group by adding
% the inversion as an additional symmetry element.

csLaue = union(cs,rotation.inversion)

plot(csLaue)

%%
% More directly, the Laue group corresponding to an arbitrary point group
% can be defined by the command

cs.Laue

%%
% Since all Laue groups can be derived from the 11 enantiomorphic groups
% there are also 11 Laue groups, namely -1, 2/m, mmm, -3, -3m, -4/m, 4/mmm,
% 6/m, 6/mmm, m-3, m-3m.
%
% The Laue groups have always exactly twice as many symmetry elements as
% the corresponding enantiomorphic group. As the following example
% illustrates each symmetry element from the enantiomorphic group occurs
% two times - with and without inversion - in the corresponding Laue group.

cs = crystalSymmetry('222');
rotation(cs)
rotation(cs.Laue)


%% Point groups
%
% While the enantiomorphic groups contain exclusivly proper rotations and
% Laue groups contain a proper and an improper version of each rotation,
% there are also symmetry groups with improper rotations that do not
% contain the inversion, e.g. the point group mm2

cs = crystalSymmetry('mm2')
rotation(cs)
plot(cs)

%%
% We observe that mm2 has exactly the same rotations as 222 with the only
% difference that half of them are improper. In fact, we can derive all
% remaining 10 point groups by replacing half of the rotations of a
% enantiomorphic group by its improper version. This way the following
% point groups can be constructed: m, mm2, 3m, -4, 4m2, -42m, -6, 6mm,
% -6m2, -43m. In total this gives us 11 enantiomorphic + 11 Laue + 10 mixed
% = 32 point groups.
%
% In MTEX we may use the following commands to find the corresponding
% enantiomorphic group and the corresponding Laue group to any mixed group

cs = crystalSymmetry('-4m2')

mtexFigure('layout',[1 3]);
plot(cs)
mtexTitle(char(cs,'LaTex'))
nextAxis
plot(cs.properGroup)
mtexTitle(char(cs.properGroup,'LaTex'))
nextAxis
plot(cs.Laue)
mtexTitle(char(cs.Laue,'LaTex'))

%% The Subgroup of proper rotations
%
% The enantiomorphic group of a given point group is in general not an
% subgroup, i.e., it does contain symmetry elements that do not belong to
% the original point group. If one is interested in the subgroup of proper
% rotations of a given point group the following command comes into help

plot(cs.properSubGroup)
mtexTitle(char(cs.properSubGroup,'LaTex'))

%% Alignment of the symmetry operations
%
% Although in general only 32 point groups are distingished, some of them
% allow for different alignments of the symmetry operations with respect to
% the crystal axes. The following plots show three different alignments of
% the point group 2mm. Note that the a-axis points in all three case
% towards south.

mtexFigure('layout',[1 3]);
cs = crystalSymmetry('2mm');
plot(cs)
mtexTitle(char(cs,'LaTex'))
annotate(cs.aAxis,'labeled')

nextAxis
cs = crystalSymmetry('m2m');
plot(cs)
mtexTitle(char(cs,'LaTex'))
annotate(cs.aAxis,'labeled')

nextAxis
cs = crystalSymmetry('mm2');
plot(cs)
mtexTitle(char(cs,'LaTex'))
annotate(cs.aAxis,'labeled')

%%
% Similarly as with mm2, there are different alignements for the point
% groups 112, 121, 211, 11m, 1m1, m11, 321, 312, 3m1, 31m, etc.
%

%% Space groups
%
% If additionally to the proper and improper rotations also translations
% are considered as symmetry operations the number of different symmetry
% groups increases to 320. Those are exhaustivly described in the
% international table of crystallography. 
%
% MTEX currently does not support space groups. If the name of a space
% group os passed to the command crystalSymmetry, MTEX automatically
% determines the corresponding point group and assigns it to the variable.

cs = crystalSymmetry('Td');
plot(cs)


%% Computations with symmetries
%
% Using the commands <symmetry.union.html union> and
% <symmetry.disjoint.html disjoint> new symmetries can be computed
% from two given ones

union(crystalSymmetry('23'),crystalSymmetry('4'))

disjoint(crystalSymmetry('432'),crystalSymmetry('622'))



%% Import from CIF and PHL files
%
% MTEX allows to define a crystal symmetry by importing a crystallographic
% information file (*.cif)

cs = crystalSymmetry.load('quartz')

%%
% or a Bruker phl file. As a phl file contains usually many phases the
% output is a list of crystal symmetries

% import a list of crystal symmetries
cs_list = crystalSymmetry.load('crystal.phl');

% access the first symmetry in list
cs_list{1}
