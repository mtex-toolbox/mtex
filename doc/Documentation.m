%% Documentation
%
%%
% Use the left sidebar to navigate through the different topics. Note that
% all documentation pages are essentially MTEX scripts. You have a copy of
% them in your MTEX download, with a file name equal to the last part of
% the URL with .html swapped for .m (so this page is |Documentation.m|).
% This means you can open them in Matlab by typing
%
%   edit fileName
%
% This allows you to execute the sections by step by step and investiage
% the effect of each single MTEX command. It also should motivate you to
% play around with different parameters, different input files or further
% analysis steps. Eventually, these documentation scripts may serve as a
% good starting point for your own analysis scripts.
%
%% Contributing to the Documentation
%
% Documenting a project like MTEX is a challenging and ongoing task.
% Therefore we are extremely happy about any spelling fixes, examples,
% theoretical explainations, special use cases, etc. As a bonus everybody
% who contributed to MTEX will automatically appear at the
% <https://github.com/mtex-toolbox/mtex/graphs/contributors contributors
% page>.
%
% The easiest way to suggest changes to the MTEX documentation is online
% via Github. This is done as follows:
%
% # sign into <https://github.com GitHub>
% # open the help page you want to change, e.g., this one
% # click
% <https://github.com/mtex-toolbox/mtex/blob/develop/doc/Documentation.m
% edit page> which leads you to the file on <https://github.com GitHub>
% # click the little pencil in the top right corner which allows you to
% edit the script online
% # enter or copy and paste your changes into the site
% # click at the bottom *Propose changes*
% # click create *pull request*
%
% Alternatively, you can send us your changes simply by <mailto:ralf.hielscher@mathematik.tu-chemnitz.de email>.
%
%% The Publish Command
%
% You may get a visual preview of your altered documentation page by using the
% matlab function
% <https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/publishing-matlab-code.html publish>
%
%   publish filename
%
% which creates an folder, named |html|, in your current directory where you can
% find the generated html page.
