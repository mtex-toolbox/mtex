%% Documentation
%
% Use the left sidebar to navigate through the different topics. Note that all
% documentation pages are essentially MTEX scripts. This means you can open them
% in Matlab by typing
%
%   edit fileName
%
% This allows you to execute the sections by step by step and investiage the
% effect of each single MTEX command. It also should motivate you to play around
% with different parameters, different input files or further analysis
% steps. Eventually, these documentation scripts may serve as a good starting
% point for your own analysis scripts.
%
%% Contributing to the Documentation
%
% Documenting a project like MTEX is a challenging and ongoing task. Therefore
% we are extremely happy about any spelling fixes, examples, theoretical
% explainations, special use cases, etc. As a bonus everybody who contributed to
% MTEX will automatically appear at the <https://github.com/mtex-toolbox/mtex/graphs/contributors contributors page>.
%
% The easiest way to suggest changes to the MTEX documentation is online via
% Github. This is done as follows:
%
% # sign into <https://github.com GitHub>
% # open the help page you want to change, e.g., this one
% # click
% <https://github.com/mtex-toolbox/mtex/blob/develop/doc/Documentation.m
% edit page> which leads you to the file on <https://github.com GitHub>
% # click the little pencil in the top right corner which allows you to
% edit the script online
% # enter of copy and paste your changes into the site
% # click at the bottom *suggest changes*
% # click create *pull request*
%
% Alternatively, you can send us you changes simply by <mailto:ralf.hielscher@mathematik.tu-chemnitz.de email>.
%
%% The Publish Command
%
% You may get a visual preview of your altered documentation page by using the
% matlab function
% <https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/publishing-matlab-code.html publish>
%
%   publish filename
%
% which creates an folder, named |html|, in your current directory where you can
% find the generated html page.
