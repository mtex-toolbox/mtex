%% ODF Estimation from EBSD data
%
%%
% In order to discuss ODF estimation from individual orientation data we
% start by loading an EBSD data set

mtexdata copper

plot(ebsd,ebsd.orientations)

%%
% of copper. The orientation distribution function can now be computed by

odf = calcDensity(ebsd('copper').orientations)

%%
% The function <rotation.calcDensity.html calcDensity> implements the ODF
% estimation from EBSD data in MTEX. The underlying statistical method is
% called kernel density estimation, which can be seen as a generalized
% histogram. To be more precise, let's $\psi : SO(3) \to R$ be a radially
% symmetric, unimodal model ODF. Then the kernel density estimator for the
% individual orientation data $o_1,o_2,\ldots,o_M$ is defined as
%
% $$f(o) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} \psi(o o_i^{-1})$$
%
% The choice of the model ODF $\psi$ and in particular its halfwidth has a
% great impact in the resulting ODF. If no halfwidth is specified the
% default halfwidth of 10 degrees is selected.
%
%% Automatic halfwidth selection
%
% MTEX includes an automatic halfwidth selection algorithm which is called
% by the command <orientation.calcKernel.html calcKernel>. To work
% properly, this algorithm needs spatially independent EBSD data as in the
% case of this dataset of very rough EBSD measurements (only one
% measurement per grain).

% try to compute an optimal kernel
psi = calcKernel(ebsd.orientations)

%%
% In the above example, the EBSD measurements are spatial dependent and the
% resulting halfwidth is too small. To avoid this problem we have to perform
% grain reconstruction first and then estimate the halfwidth from the
% grains.

% grains reconstruction
grains = calcGrains(ebsd);

% correct for to small grains
grains = grains(grains.grainSize>5);

% compute optimal halfwidth from the meanorientations of grains
psi = calcKernel(grains('co').meanOrientation)

% compute the ODF with the kernel psi
odf = calcDensity(ebsd('co').orientations,'kernel',psi)


%%
% Once an ODF is estimated all the functionality MTEX offers for
% <ODFCharacteristics.html ODF analysis> and <ODFPlot.html ODF
% visualization> is available.

h = [Miller(1,0,0,odf.CS),Miller(1,1,0,odf.CS),Miller(1,1,1,odf.CS)];
plotPDF(odf,h,'antipodal','silent')


%% Effect of halfwidth selection
%
% As mentioned above a proper halfwidth selection is crucial for ODF
% estimation. The following simple numerical experiment illustrates the
% dependency between the kernel halfwidth and the estimated error.
%
% Let's start with a model ODF and simulate some individual orientation data.

modelODF = fibreODF(Miller(1,1,1,crystalSymmetry('cubic')),xvector);
ori = discreteSample(modelODF,10000)

%%
% Next we define a list of kernel halfwidth ,

hw = [1*degree, 2*degree, 4*degree, 8*degree, 16*degree, 32*degree];

%%
% estimate for each halfwidth an ODF and compare it to the original ODF.

e = zeros(size(hw));
for i = 1:length(hw)
  
  odf = calcDensity(ori,'halfwidth',hw(i),'silent');
  e(i) = calcError(modelODF, odf);
  
end

%%
% After visualizing the estimation error we observe that its value is large 
% either if we choose a very small or a very large halfwidth.
% In this specific example, the optimal halfwidth seems to be about 4
% degrees.
