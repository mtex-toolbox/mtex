%% Denoising Orientation Maps
%
% Orientation maps determined by EBSD or any other technique are, as all
% experimental data, effected by measurement errors. Those measurement
% errors can be divided into systematic errors and random errors.
% Systematic errors mostly occur due to a bad calibration of the EBSD
% system and require additional knowledge to be corrected. Deviations from
% the true orientation due to noisy Kikuchi pattern or tolerances of the
% indecing algorithm can be modeled as random errors. In this section we
% demonstrate how random errors can be significantly reduced using
% denoising techniques.
%
% Simultanously while denoising orientation maps one can also fill not
% indexed pixels. This is explained in the section <EBSDFilling.html Fill
% Missing Data>.
%
%%
% We shall demonstrate the denoising capabilities of MTEX at the hand of an
% orientation map of deformed Magnesium.

% import the data
mtexdata twins

% consider only indexed data
ebsd = ebsd('indexed');

% reconstruct the grain structure
[grains,ebsd.grainId,ebsd.mis2mean] = calcGrains(ebsd,'angle',10*degree);

% remove some very small grains
ebsd(grains(grains.grainSize<5)) = [];

% redo grain segementation
[grains,ebsd.grainId] = calcGrains(ebsd,'angle',10*degree);

% smooth grain boundaries
grains = smooth(grains,5);

% plot the orientation map
ipfKey = ipfColorKey(ebsd.CS.properGroup);
plot(ebsd,ipfKey.orientation2color(ebsd.orientations))

% and on top the grain boundaries
hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off

%%
% At the first glance, the orientation data look not noisy at all. However,
% if we look at orientation changes within the grains the noise we become
% clearly visible. To do so we colorize the orientation data with respect
% to their misorientation to the grain mean orientation

% the axisAngleColorKey colorizes misorientation according to their axis
% and angle
colorKey = axisAngleColorKey;

% we need to set the reference orientations are the mean orientation of
% each grain
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsd.grainId).meanOrientation;

% lets plot the result
plot(ebsd,colorKey.orientation2color(ebsd.orientations))
hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off

%%
% We clearly observe some deformation gradients withing the grains which
% are superposed by random noise. 

%% The Mean Filter
%
% The simplest filter to apply to orientation data is the @meanFilter which
% replaces all orientations by the mean of all neighboring orientations.

% define the meanFilter
F = meanFilter;
F.numNeighbours = 1;

% smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd,F); 
ebsdS = ebsdS('indexed');

% plot the smoothed data
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsdS, colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off

%%
% We clearly see how the noise has been reduces. In order to further reduce
% the noise we may increase the number of neighbors that are taken into
% account. 

F.numNeighbours = 3;

% smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd,F);
ebsdS = ebsdS('indexed');

% plot the smoothed data
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsdS,colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off

%% The Median Filter
%
% The disadvantage of the mean filter is that is smoothes away all subgrain
% boundaries and is quite sensitive against outliers. A more robust filter
% which also preserves subgrain boundaries is the median filter

F = medianFilter;

% define the size of the window to be used for finding the median
F.numNeighbours = 3; % this corresponds to a 7x7 window

% smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd,F);
ebsdS = ebsdS('indexed');

% plot the smoothed data
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsdS,colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off

%%
% The disadvantage of the median filter is that it leads to cartoon like
% images which suffer from the staircase effect. 

%% The Kuwahara Filter
% Another filter that was designed to be robust against outliers and does
% not smooth away subgrain boundaries is the Kuwahara filter. However, in
% practical applications the results are often not satisfactory.

F = KuwaharaFilter;
F.numNeighbours = 5;

% smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd,F);
ebsdS = ebsdS('indexed');

% plot the smoothed data
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsdS,colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off

%% The Smoothing Spline Filter
%
% All the above filters are so called sliding windows filters which
% consider for the denoising operation only neighboring orientations within
% a certain window. The next filters belong to the class of variational
% filters which determine the denoised orientation map as the solution of
% an minimization problem that is simultaneously close to the original map
% and "smooth". The resulting orientation map heavily depends on the
% specific definition of "smooth" and on the regularization parameter which
% controls the trade of between fitting the original data and forcing the
% resulting map to be smooth.
%
% The @splineFilter uses as definition of smoothness the curvature of the
% orientation map. As a consequence, the denoised images are very "round"
% and similarly as for the @meanFilter subgrain boundaries will be smoothed
% away. On the positive side the @meanFilter is up to now the only filter
% that automatically calibrates the regularization parameter.

F = splineFilter;

% smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd,F);
ebsdS = ebsdS('indexed');

% plot the smoothed data
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsdS,colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off

% the smoothing parameter determined during smoothing is
F.alpha

%% The Halfquadratic Filter
%
% In the default setting the @halfQuadraticFilter uses definition of
% smoothness the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_variation_denoising
% total variation> functional. This functional was developed to preserve
% subgrain boundaries. Similarly as the @medianFilter it tends to carton
% like images and staircasing.

F = halfQuadraticFilter;

% smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd,F);
ebsdS = ebsdS('indexed');

% plot the smoothed data
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsdS,colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off


%% The Infimal Convolution Filter
% 
% The infimal convolution filter was designed as a compromise between the
% @splineFilter and the @halfQuadraticFilter. It is still under development
% and its use is not recommended.

F = infimalConvolutionFilter;
F.lambda = 0.01; % smoothing parameter for the gradient
F.mu = 0.005;    % smoothing parameter for the hessian

% smooth the data
ebsdS = smooth(ebsd,F);
ebsdS = ebsdS('indexed');

% plot the smoothed data
colorKey.oriRef = grains(ebsdS.grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsdS,colorKey.orientation2color(ebsdS.orientations))

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off
