%% Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM)
%
%%
% The kernel average misorientation (KAM) is a measure of local grain
% misorientation that is usually derived from EBSD data. For formaly
% defining the KAM we denote by $o_{i,j}$ the orientations at pixel
% position $(i,j)$ and by $N(i,j)$ the set of all neighboring pixels. Then
% the kernel average misorientation $\mathrm{kam}_{i,j}$ at pixel position
% $(i,j)$ is defined as
% 
% $$\mathrm{KAM}_{i,j} = \frac{1}{|N(i,j)|}\sum_{(k,l) \in N(i,j)} \omega(o_{i,j}, o_{k,l}) $$
% 
% Here $|N(i,j)|$ denotes the number of all neighboring pixels
% taking into account and $\omega(o_{i,j}, o_{k,l})$ the disorientation
% angle between the orientation $o_{ij}$ in the center and the neighbouring
% orientation $(o_{k,l})$. The specific choice of the set $N(i,j)$ of
% neighboring pixels is crucial for the compution of the KAM. Most commonly
% the following additional constrains are made
%
% * consider neighbors up to order $n$, e.g. $n=1,2,3,\ldots$
% * consider only neighbors belonging to the same grain
% * consider only neighbors with a misorientation angle smaller than a
% threshold angle $\delta$
% 
% In the case of sqaure and hexagonal grids the order of neighbors is
% illustrated below

%% A Deformed Ferrite Specimen

% Let us demonstrate the computation of the KAM at the example of a
% deformed Ferrite specimen. Lets import the data first and reconstruct the
% grain structure

[grains,ebsd.grainId] = calcGrains(ebsd('indexed'));
% remove one-three pixel grains
ebsd(grains(grains.grainSize <= 3)) = [];
[grains,ebsd.grainId] = calcGrains(ebsd('indexed'));

grains = smooth(grains,5);

% Although MTEX allows the computation of the KAM from arbitrarily sampled
% EBSD maps the algorithms are much faster an memory efficient if the maps
% are measured on regular hexagonal or rectangular grid - as it is standard
% in most applications. The command <EBSD.gridify.html |gridify|> makes
% MTEX aware of such an underlying regular measurement grid.

ebsd = ebsd.gridify;

%
% The kernel average misorientation is computed by the command
% <EBSD.KAM.html |ebsd.KAM|>. As all MTEX commands it return the mean
% disorientation angle in radiant. Hence, dividing by the constant |degree|
% gives the result in degree.

kam = ebsd.KAM / degree;

% When computed with default parameters in MTEX neighbors up to order 1 are
% considered and no threshold angle $\delta$ is applied. If grains have
% been reconstructed and the property |ebsd.grainId| has been set (as we
% did above) only misorientations within the same grain are considered. As
% a consequence the resulting KAM map is dominated by the orientation
% gradients at the subgrain boundaries.
%
% Specifying a reasonable small theshold angle $\delta=2.5^{\circ}$ the
% subgrain boundaries can be effectively removed from the KAM.

% Unfortunately, the remaining KAM becomes very sensitve to measurement

% Although this reduced noise it also smoothes away local dislocation
% structures. A much more effective way to reduce the effect of measurement
% errors to the kernel average misorientation is to denoise the EBSD map
% first and compute than the KAM from the first order neighbors. 

% chose a denoising filter
