%% EBSD Orientation Analysis
%
%% 
% Here we discuss tools for the analysis of EBSD data which are independent
% of its spatial coordinates. For spatial analysis, we refer to
% <EBSDProfile.html this page>. Let us first import some EBSD data:

mtexdata forsterite silent

plot(ebsd)

%% Orientation plot
% We start our investigations of the Forsterite phase by plotting some pole
% figures

cs = ebsd('Forsterite').CS % the crystal symmetry of the forsterite phase
h = [Miller(1,0,0,cs),Miller(0,1,0,cs),Miller(0,0,1,cs)];
plotPDF(ebsd('Forsterite').orientations,h,'antipodal')

%%
% From the {100} pole figure, we might suspect a fibre texture present in
% our data. Let's check this. First, we determine the vector orthogonal to
% fibre in the {100} pole figure

% the orientations of the Forsterite phase
ori = ebsd('Forsterite').orientations
% the vectors in the 100 pole figure
r = ori * Miller(1,0,0,ori.CS)

% the vector best orthogonal to all r
rOrth = perp(r)

% output
plot(rOrth,'add2all','Marker','square','markerColor','DarkRed')

%%
% we can check how large is the number of orientations that are in the
% (100) pole figure within a 10-degree fibre around the great circle with
% center |rOrth|, i.e., in the region bounded by the two small circles

nextAxis(1)
circle(rOrth,80 * degree,'lineColor','darkred','linewidth',5,'EdgeAlpha',0.5)

%% 
% The following line gives the result in percent

100 * sum(angle(r,rOrth)>80*degree) / length(ori)

%%
% Next, we want to answer the question which crystal direction is mapped to
% |rOrth|. To this end, we look at the corresponding inverse pole figure

plotIPDF(ebsd('Forsterite').orientations,rOrth,'smooth')
mtexColorbar

%%
% From the inverse pole figure, it becomes clear that the orientations are
% close to the fibre |Miller(0,1,0)|, |rOrth|. Let's check this by
% computing the fibre volume in percent

% define the fibre
f = fibre(Miller(0,1,0,cs),rOrth);

% compute the volume along the fibre
100 * volume(ebsd('Forsterite').orientations,f,10*degree)

%%
% Surprisingly this value is significantly lower than the value we obtained
% we looking only at the 100 pole figure. Finally, let's plot the ODF along
% this fibre

odf = calcDensity(ebsd('Forsterite').orientations)

% plot the odf along the fibre
plot(odf,f,'linewidth',2)
ylim([0,26])

%%
% We see that to ODF is far from being constant along the fibre. Thus,
% together with an observation about the small fibre volume, we would
% reject the hypothesis of a fibre texture.
%
% Let's finally plot the ODF in orientation space to verify our decision

plot(odf,'sigma')

%%
% Here we see the typical large individual spots that are typical for
% large grains. Thus the ODF estimated from the EBSD data
% and all our previous analysis suffer from the fact that too few grains
% have been measured. For texture analysis, it would have been favorable to
% measure at a lower resolution but a larger region.
