%% Example for 2d EBSD Data analysis

%  data by Daniel Rutte with Bret Hacker, Stanford.
%
% The following script mainly generate the figures shown in "Grain detection
% from 2d and 3d EBSD data - Specification of the MTEX algorithm" - section "Practical
% application to a 2d EBSD data set". The only imposed restriction is the size of the
% data set, which was scaled down.
