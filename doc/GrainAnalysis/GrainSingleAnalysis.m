%% Connection between grains and EBSD data
% As usual, let us first import some EBSD data construct some grains

close all

% consider only indexed data for grain segmentation
ebsd = ebsd('indexed');
% perform grain segmentation
[grains,ebsd.grainId,ebsd.mis2mean] = calcGrains(ebsd);

%%
% The <GrainSet_index.html GrainSet> contains the EBSD data it was reconstructed from. We can
% access these data by

grain_selected = grains( grains.grainSize >=  1160)
ebsd_selected = ebsd(grain_selected)

%%
% A more convinient way to select grains in daily practice, is by spatial
% coordinates. 

grain_selected = grains(12000,3000)

%%
% you can get the id of this grain by

grain_selected.id

%%
% lets look for the grain with the largest grain orientation spread

[~,id] = max(grains.GOS)
grain_selected = grains(id)

%% Testing on Bingham distribution for a single grain
% Although the orientations of an individual grain are highly concentrated,
% they may vary in the shape. In particular, if the grain was deformed by
% some process, we are interessed in quantifications.

cs = ebsd(grain_selected).CS;
ori = ebsd(grain_selected).orientations;

%%
% Testing on the distribution shows a gentle prolatness, nevertheless we
% would reject the hypothesis for some level of significance, since the
% distribution is highly concentrated and the numerical results vague.

%% Profiles through a single grain
% Sometimes, grains show large orientation difference when beeing deformed
% and then its of interest, to characterize the lattice rotation. One way
% is to order orientations along certain line segment and look at the
% profile.
%%
% We proceed by specifiing such a line segment

% The command <EBSD.spatialProfile.html spatialProfile> restricts the EBSD
% data to this line

% Next, we plot the misorientation angle to the first point of the line
% as well as the orientation gradient

close all % close previous plots

% misorientation angle to the first orientation on the line

% We can also plot the orientations along this line into inverse pole
% figures and colorize them according to their y-coordinate
