%% Misorientations at grain boundaries
% Analyze misorientations along grain boundaries
%
% This example explains how to analyze boundary misorientation by means of
% misorientation axes
%
%% Import EBSD data and select a subregion
%
% First step is as always to import the data. Here we restrict the big data
% set to a subregion to make the results easier to visualize

% take some MTEX data set
mtexdata forsterite

% define a sub region
xmin = 25000;
xmax = 35000;
ymin = 4500;
ymax = 9000;

region = [xmin ymin xmax-xmin ymax-ymin];

% visualize the whole data set
plot(ebsd)
% and mark the sub region
rectangle('position',region,'edgecolor','r','linewidth',2)

% select EBSD data within region
condition = inpolygon(ebsd,region); % select indices by polygon
ebsd = ebsd(condition);

%% Grain reconstruction
%
% Second step is the reconstruction of the grains and grain boundaries

% segmentation angle typically 10 to 15 degrees that separates two grains
seg_angle = 10;

% minimum indexed points per grain between 5 and 10
min_points = 10;

% restrict to indexed only points
[grains,ebsd.grainId,ebsd.mis2mean] = ...
  calcGrains(ebsd('indexed'),'angle',seg_angle*degree,'minPixel',min_points);

% smooth grains
grains = smooth(grains,4);

% plot the data
% Note, only the forsterite grains are colored. Grains with different
% phase remain white
plot(grains('fo'),grains('fo').meanOrientation,'micronbar','off','figSize','large')
hold on
plot(grains.boundary)
hold off

%% Visualize the misorientation angle at grain boundaries

% define the linewidth
lw = 6;

% consider on Fo-Fo boundaries
gB = grains.boundary('Fo','Fo');

% The following command reorders the boundary segments such that they are
% connected. This has two advantages:
% 1. the plots become more smooth
% 2. you can consider every third line segment as we do in the next paragraph
gB = gB.reorder;

% visualize the misorientation angle
% draw the boundary in black very thick 
hold on
plot(gB,'linewidth',lw+2);

% and on top of it the boundary colorized according to the misorientation
% angle
hold on
plot(gB,gB.misorientation.angle./degree,'linewidth',lw);
hold off
mtexColorMap jet
mtexColorbar('title','misorientation angle in degrees')

%% Visualize the misorientation axes in specimen coordinates
% Computing the misorientation axes in specimen coordinates can not be done
% using the boundary misorientations only. In fact, we require the
% orientations on both sides of the grain boundary. Lets extract them
% first.

% do only consider every third boundary segment
Sampling_N=3;
gB = gB(1:Sampling_N:end);

% the following command gives an Nx2 matrix of orientations which contains
% for each boundary segment the orientation on both sides of the boundary.
ori = ebsd('id',gB.ebsdId).orientations;

% the misorientation axis in specimen coordinates
gB_axes = axis(ori(:,1),ori(:,2),'antipodal');

% axes can be plotted using the command quiver
hold on
quiver(gB,gB_axes,'linewidth',2,'color','k','autoScaleFactor',0.3)
hold off

%%
% Note, the shorter the axes the more they stick out of the surface.
% What may be a bit surprising is that the misorientations axes have some
% abrupt changes at the left hands side grain boundary. The reason for this
% is that the misorientations angle at this boundary is close to the
% maximum misorientation angle of 120 degree. As a consequence, slight
% changes in the misorientation may lead to a completely different
% disorientation, i.e., a different but symmetrically equivalent
% misorientation has a smaller misorientation angle.
