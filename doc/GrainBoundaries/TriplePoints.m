%% Triple points
%
%%
% Triple points are automaticaly computed during grain reconstruction. They
% are accessable similarly to <GrainBoundaries.html grain boundaries> as
% the property <triplePointList.triplePointList.html triplePoints> of the
% grain list. When analyzing triple points it is a good idea to use the
% option <QuadruplePoints.html |removeQuadruplePoints|> in
% <ebsd.calcGrains.html |calcGrains|> to convert all quadruple points into
% triple points.

% import some EBSD data set
mtexdata small silent

% compute grains
grains = calcGrains(ebsd('indexed'),'removeQuadruplePoints');
%grains = calcGrains(ebsd('indexed'));

% smooth the grains a bit
grains = smooth(grains,2);

% plot the grains
plot(grains);

% extract all triple points
tP = grains.triplePoints;

% and plot the on top 
hold on
plot(tP,'color','b','linewidth',2)
hold off

%% Index triple points by phase
%
% You may index triple points by the adjacent phases. The following command
% gives you all triple points with at least one phase being Forsterite

tP('Forsterite')

%%
% The following command gives you all triple points with at least two
% phases being Forsterite

tP('Forsterite','Forsterite')

%%
% Finaly, we may mark all inner Diopside triple points

hold on
plot(tP('Diopside','Diopside','Diopside'),'displayName','Di-Di-Di','color','darkred','linewidth',2)
hold off

%% Index triple points by grains
%
% Since, triple points are asociated to grains we may single out triple
% points that belong to a specific grain or some subset of grains.

% find the index of the largest grain
[~,id] = max(grains.area);

% the triple points that belong to the largest grain
tP = grains(id).triplePoints;

% plot these triple points
plot(grains(id),'FaceColor',[0.2 0.8 0.8],'displayName','largest grains');
hold on
plot(grains.boundary)
plot(tP,'color','r','linewidth',2)
hold off


%% Index triple points by grain boundary
%
% Triple points are not only a property of grains but also of grain
% boundaries. Thus we may ask for all triple points that belong to
% Fosterite - Forsterite boundaries with misorientation angle larger then
% 60 degree

% all Fosterite - Forsterite boundary segments
gB_Fo = grains.boundary('Forsterite','Forsterite')

% Fo - Fo segments with misorientation angle larger 60 degree
gB_large = gB_Fo(gB_Fo.misorientation.angle>60*degree)

% plot the triple points
plot(grains)
hold on
plot(gB_large,'linewidth',2,'linecolor','w')
plot(gB_large.triplePoints,'color','m','linewidth',2)
hold off


%% Boundary segments from triple points
%
% On the other hand we may also ask for the boundary segments that build up
% a triple point. These are stored as the property boundaryId for each
% triple points. 
%

% lets take Forsterite triple points
tP = grains.triplePoints('Fo','Fo','Fo');

% the boundary segments which form the triple points
gB = grains.boundary(tP.boundaryId);

% plot the triple point boundary segments
plot(grains)
hold on
plot(gB,'lineColor','w','linewidth',2)
hold off

%%
% Once we have extracted the boundary segments adjecent to a triple point
% we may also extract the corresponding misorientations. The following
% command gives a n x 3 list of misorientations where n is the number of
% triple points

mori = gB.misorientation

%% 
% Hence, we can compute for each triple point the sum of misorientation
% angles by

sumMisAngle = sum(mori.angle,2);

%%
% and my visualize it by

plot(grains,'figSize','large')
hold on
plot(tP,sumMisAngle ./ degree,'markerEdgeColor','w','MarkerSize',8)
hold off

%% Angles at triple points
% 
% The angles at the triplepoints can be accessed by |tP.angles|. This is a
% 3 column matrix with one column for each of the three angles enclosed by
% the boundary segments of a triple point. Obviously, the sum of each row
% is always |2*pi|. More interestingly is the difference between the
% largest and the smallest angle. Lets plot this for our test data set.

plot(grains,'figSize','large')
hold on
tP = grains.triplePoints;
plot(tP,(max(tP.angles,[],2)-min(tP.angles,[],2))./degree,'markerEdgeColor','w','MarkerSize',8)
