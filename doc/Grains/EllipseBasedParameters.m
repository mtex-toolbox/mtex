%% Ellipse Based Shape Parameters
%
%%
% In this section we discuss geometric properties of grains that are
% related to ellipses fitted to the grains. Most importantly these are the
% centroid |c|, the long axis |a| and the short axis |b| that are computed
% by the command <grain2d.fitEllipse.html |[c,a,b] = grains.fitEllipse|>.
% Based on these quantities the <grain2d.aspectRatio.html |aspectRatio|> is
% defined as the quotient |a/b| between long and short axis.
%
% In order to demonstrate these properties we start by reconstructing the
% grain structure from a sample EBSD data set.

% load sample EBSD data set
mtexdata forsterite silent

% reconstruct grains and smooth them 
[grains, ebsd.grainId] = calcGrains(ebsd('indexed'),'angle',5*degree,'minPixel',10);

grains(grains.isBoundary) = [];

grains = smooth(grains('indexed'),10,'moveTriplePoints');

% plot the grains
plot(grains,'micronbar','off','lineWidth',2)

%% Fit Ellipses
%
% The basic command for fitting ellipses is <grain2d.fitEllipse
% |fitEllipse|>

[c,a,b] = grains.fitEllipse;

plotEllipse(c,a,b,'lineColor','w','linewidth',2)

%%
% The returned variable |c| is the centroid of the grains, |a| and |b| are
% of type |@vector3d| and are longest and shortest half axes. Note, that
% the ellipses are scaled such that the area of the ellipse coincides with
% the actual grain area. Alternatively, one can also scale the ellipse to
% fit the boundary length by using the option |boundary|.
%
%% Long and Short Axes
%
% The direction of the long and the short axis of the fitted ellipse can also
% be obtained by the commands <grain2d.longAxis.html |grains.longAxis|> and
% <grain2d.shortAxis.html |grains.shortAxis|>. These directions are only
% well defined if the fitted ellipse is not to close to a perfect circle. A
% measure for how distinct the ellipse is from a perfect circle is the
% <grain2d.aspectRatio.html aspect ratio> which is defined as the quotient
% $a/b$ between the longest and the shortest axis. For a perfect circle
% the aspect ratio is $1$ and increases to infinity when the ellipse becomes
% more and more elongated.
%
% Lets colorize the grains by their aspect ratio and plot on top the long
% axis directions:

% visualize the aspect ratio
plot(grains,grains.aspectRatio,'linewidth',2,'micronbar','off')
setColorRange([0,4])
mtexColorbar('title','aspect ratio')

% and on top the long axes

%% Shape preferred orientation
%
% If we look at grains, we might wonder if there is a characteristic
% difference in the grain shape fabric between e.g. Forsterite and
% Enstatite. In contrast to crystal preferred orientations which which
% describe on the alignment of the atom lattices the shape preferred
% orientation (SPO) describes the alignment of the grains by shape in the
% bulk fabric. 
%
% *Long Axis Distribution*
% 
% The most direct way to analyze shape preferred orientations are rose
% diagrams of the distribution of the grain long axes. For those diagrams
% it is useful to weight the long axis by the grain area such that larger
% grains have a bigger impact on the distribution and by the aspect ratio
% as for grains with a small aspect ratio the long axis is not so well
% defined.

%% *Shortest Caliper Distribution*
%
% Alternatively, we may wonder if the common long axis of grains is
% suitably represented by the direction normal to the shortest caliper of
% the grains. This can particularly be the case for aligned rectangular
% particles where the long axes often switch between the diagonals of the
% particle. The <caliper.html |caliper|> or Feret of grains represents the
% projection lengths of grains in relation to a projection direction. With
% the option |'shortestPerp'|, the function returns the normal to the
% projection direction with the shortest projection length of a grain. In
% order to plot the result we could use a <vector3d.histogram.html
% |histogram|>, compute a density function or use <calcTDF.html |calcTDF|>
% with a list of angles and a list of weights or lengths as input.

%% *SPO defined by grain boundary segments*
%
% Best fit ellipses are always symmetric and the projection
% function of an entire grain always only consider the convex hull. 
% Grain shape fabrics can also be characterized by a rose diagram of the 
% directions of grain boundary segments which can consider the
% entire shape of the grain defined by the grain boundary segments but also
% works for non fully enclosed shapes i.e. just a special selection of
% grains. Here, we can weight each <grainBoundary.grainBoundary.html| direction |>
% of a grain boundary by its <grainBoundary.segLength.html| segment length|>.

%% Characteristic Shape
%
% Note that this distribution is very prone to inherit artifacts based on
% the fact that most EBSD maps are sampled on a regular grid. We tried to
% overcome this problem by heavily smoothing the grain boundary. However,
% if you recognize little peaks at 0 and 90 degree, they are most likely
% related to this sampling artifact.
%
% If we just add up all the individual boundary elements of the rose
% diagram in order of increasing angles, we derive the characteristic
% shape. It can be regarded as to represent the average grain shape. The <
% grainBoundary.characteristicShape.html |characteristicShape|>does not
% require entire grains as input but works with a list of
% <BoundarySelect.html grain boundaries>. Many operations such as
% |aspectRatio| or |longAxis| also work on the characteristic shape.
