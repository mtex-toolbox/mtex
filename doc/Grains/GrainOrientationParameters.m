%% Grain average orientation
%
% As by construction grains consist of pixels with similar orientation. In
% order to access all the orientations that belong to a specific grain we
% make use of the property |ebsd.grainId| where we have stored during grain
% reconstruction for every EBSD pixel to which grain it belongs. Hence, we
% may use <EBSDSelect.html logical indexing> on our EBSD variable |ebsd| to
% find all orientations that belong to a certain |grainId|.

% select a grain by x and y coordinates
grainSel = grains(42,17)

% all EBSD orientations within the grain
ori = ebsd(grainSel).orientations

%%
% We could now use the command <orientation.mean |mean|> to compute the
% grain average orientation from these individual orientations. A more
% direct approach, however, is to access the property
% |grain.meanOrientation| which has been filled with the mean orientations
% during grain reconstruction.

plot(grains, grains.meanOrientation)

%% Misorientation to the grain mean orientation
%
% Once we have a reference orientation for each grain - the grain
% meanorientation |ori_ref| - we may want to analyse the deviation of the
% individual orientations within the grain from this reference orientation.
% The _grain reference orientation deviation_ (GROD) is the
% <MisorientationTheory.html misorientation> between each pixel orientation
% to the grain mean orientation defined as

mis2mean = inv(grainSel.meanOrientation) .* ori

%%
% While the above command computes the misorientations to the grain mean
% orientation just for one grain the command <EBSD.calcGROD.html |calcGrod|>
% computes it for all grains simultaneously

mis2mean = calcGROD(ebsd, grains)

%% Grain orientation spread (GOS)
%
% The full misorientation to the mean orientation is often not so simple to
% understand. A good starting point is to just look at the misorientation
% angles to the grain mean orientation. The average of the misorientation
% angles to the grain mean orientation is called _grain orientation spread_
% (GOS) and can be computed by the command <EBSD.grainMean.html
% |grainMean|> which averages arbitrary EBSD properties over grains. Here,
% we use it to average the misorientation angle for each grain separately.

% take the avarage of the misorientation angles for each grain
GOS = ebsd.grainMean(mis2mean.angle);

% plot it
plot(grains, GOS ./ degree)
mtexColorbar('title','GOS in degree')

%%
% It should be noted that the GOS is also directly available as the grain
% property |grains.GOS|. 
%
% The function <EBSD.grainMean.html |grainMean|> can also be used to
% compute the maximum misorientation angle to the mean orientation within
% each grain. To achieve this we have to pass the function |@max| as an
% additional argument. Note, that you can replace this function also with
% any other statistics like the median, or some quantile.

% compute the maximum misorientation angles for each grain
MGOS = ebsd.grainMean(mis2mean.angle,@max);

% plot it
plot(grains, MGOS ./ degree)
mtexColorbar('title','MGOS in degree')

%% Grain average misorientation (GAM)
%
% A measure that is often confused with the grain orientation spread is the
% grain average misorientation (GAM). The GAM is defined as the
% <EBSDKAM.html kernel average misorientation (KAM)> averaged over each
% grain. Hence, we can compute is by using the functions <EBSD.KAM.html
% |ebsd.KAM|> and <EBSD.grainMean.html |grainMean|>.

gam = ebsd.grainMean(ebsd.KAM);

plot(grains,gam./degree)
mtexColorbar('title','GAM in degree')
setColorRange([0,3])

%%
% While the GOS measures global orientation gradients within a grain the
% GAM reflect the average local gradient.
%
%% The misorientation axis (crystal dispersion axis)
%
% Under certain conditions, deformation may result in the dispersion of
% orientations within a grain. This can usually be the case when
% deformation is accommodated by slip on one dominant slip system for each
% grain and conditions are such, that the resulting orientation gradients
% are preserved in the material (as it is the case in many geomaterials
% deforming at moderate temperatures). In such a case, we would expect the
% orientations inside a grain to be aligned along a line with a specific
% misorientation axis to the mean orientation. Such a line is called
% <OrientationFibre.html fibre> and we can use the command <fibre.fit.html
% |fibre.fit|> to find the best fitting fibre for a given list of
% orientations. Lets do this for a single grain. 

% visualize the orientations within the selected  grain in a pole figure
figure(2)
h = Miller({1,0,0},ebsd.CS);
plotPDF(ebsd(grainSel).orientations,h,'MarkerSize',2,'all')

% fit a fibre to the orientations within the grain
[f,lambda,fit] = fibre.fit(ebsd(grainSel).orientations,'local');

% add the fibre to the pole figure
hold on
plotPDF(f.symmetrise,h,'lineColor','orange','linewidth',2)
hold off


%%
% The function <fibre.fit.html |fibre.fit|> has three output arguments. The
% first one |f| is the fittted fibre. From this we can easily detect the
% prominent misorientation axis in specimen coordinates by |f.r| and in
% crystal coordinates by |f.h|.

f.r
f.h

% We can see that the dispersion of directions is minimal for those
% parallel to |f.r| respectively |f.h|. 
hold on
plot(ebsd(grainSel).orientations.*f.h,'MarkerSize',2,'all','MarkerFaceColor','k','antipodal')
hold off
%%
% The second output argument |lambda| are the eigenvalues of the
% orientation matrix. The largest eigenvalue indicates are localized the
% orientations are. The second largest eigenvalue is a measure how much the
% orientation distributed along the fitted fibre. The third and forth
% eigenvalue describe how much the orientations scatter off the fibre.
% The scatter off the fibre is more conveniently described in the last
% output argument |fit|, which is the mean misorientation angle of the
% orientations to the fitted fibre.

  % store the misorientation axes in crystal and specimen symmetry
  GAX_C(k) = f.h;
  GAX_S(k) = f.r;
    
end

%%
% And plot the fit, the third and the second largest eigenvalues. We
% clearly see how the fit is related to the third largest eigenvalue
% $\lambda_2$.

% *The crystal dispersion axes in crystal coordinates*
%
% In order to visualize the crystal dispersion axes we first need to define an
% appropriate color key for crystal directions. This can be done with the
% command <HSVDirectionKey.html |HSVDirectionKey|>. Note, that we need to
% specify the option |'antipodal'| since for the crystal dispersion axes we can
% not distinguish between antipodal directions.

% define the color key
cKey = HSVDirectionKey(ebsd.CS,'antipodal');

% plot the color key and on top the dispersion axes
plot(cKey)
hold on

%%
% Now we can use this colorkey to visualize the misorientation axes in the
% grain map

% compute colors from the misorientation axes
color = cKey.direction2color(GAX_C);

% plot the colored grains
plot(grainsLarge, color)

%% 
% *The crystal dispersion axes in specimen coordinates*
%
% Colorizing the crystal dispersion axes in specimen coordinates is
% unfortunately much more complicated. In fact, it is mathematically
% impossible to find a corresponding color key without color jumps. Instead
% MTEX visualizes axes in specimen coordinates by compass needles which are
% entirely gray if in the plane and get divided into black and white to
% indicate which end points out of the plane and which into the plane.

% In many materials, a direct relation can be observed between the position
% of the crystal dispersion axis in specimen coordinates and the inferred
% type of flow. E.g. in many geomaterials which have undergone (close to)
% simple shear progressive deformation, the average of the crystal dispersion 
% axes align parallel to the vorticity axis of flow; in pure shear progressive
% deformation, crystal dispersion axes form a girdle with a normal parallel
% to the shortening direction.

plot(GAX_S,'antipodal','MarkerSize',4)

% to get some idea about any preferred direction, we can add contours,
% weighted by the fit. grains with a large mean misorientation angle will
% also have a more well defined direction of the dispersion axis.

% Here we do not see this clear of a picture (maybe because this is a piece
% of steel which might behave differently, maybe because we do not consider
