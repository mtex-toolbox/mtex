%% ODFs
% ODF stands for orientation distribution functions. This section explains
% how to import and export ODFs, how to define model ODFs and how to
% analyze ODFs, e.g., with respect to modalorientations, textureindex,
% volumeportions. Pole figure simulation and single orientation simulation
% is explained as well.
