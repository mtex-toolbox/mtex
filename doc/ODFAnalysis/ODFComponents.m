%% ODF Component Analysis
%
%%
% A common way to interprete ODFs is to think of them as superposition of
% different components that originate from different deformation processes
% and describe the texture of the material. In this section we describe how
% these components can be identified from a given ODF.
%
% We start by reconstruction a Quarz ODF from Neutron pole figure data.

% import Neutron pole figure data from a Quarz specimen
mtexdata dubna silent

% reconstruct the ODF
odf = calcODF(pf,'zeroRange');

% visualize the ODF in sigma sections
plotSection(odf,'sigma','sections',9,'layout',[3,3])
mtexColorbar

%% The prefered orientation
% 
% First of all we observe that the ODF posses a strong maximum. To find
% this orientation that correspondes to the maximum ODF intensity we use
% the <SO3Fun.max.html |max|> command. 

[value,ori] = max(odf)

%%
% Note that, similarly as the Matlab
% <https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/max.html |max|> command, the
% second output argument is the position where the maximum is atained. In
% our case we observe that the maximum value is about |121|.  To visualize
% the corresponding preferred orientation we plot it into the sigma
% sections of the ODF.

annotate(ori)

%%
% We may not only use the command <SO3Fun.max.html |max|> to find the global
% maximum of an ODF but also to find a certain amount of local maxima. The
% number of local maxima MTEX should search for, is specified as by the
% option |'numLocal'|, i.e., to find the three largest local maxima do

[value,ori] = max(odf,'numLocal',3)

annotate(ori)

%%
% Note, that orientations are returned sorted according to their ODF value.
%
%% Volume Portions
%
% It is important to understand, that the value of the ODF at a preferred
% orientation is in general not sufficient to judge the importance of a
% component. Very sharp components may result in extremely large ODF values
% that represent only very little volume. A more robust and physically more
% relevant quantity is the relative volume of crystal that have an
% orientation close to the preferred orientation. This volume portion can
% be computed by the command <SO3Fun.volume.html, |volume(odf,ori,delta)|>
% where |ori| is a list of preferred orientations and |delta| is the
% maximum disorientation angle. Multiplying with $100$ the output will be
% in percent

delta = 10*degree;
volume(odf,ori,delta) * 100


%%
% We observe that the sum of all volume portions is far from $100$ percent.
% This is very typical. The reason is that the portion of the full
% orientations space that is within the $10$ degree disorientation distance
% from the preferred orientations is very small. More precisely, it
% represents only

volume(uniformODF(odf.CS),ori(1),delta) * 100

%%
% percent of the entiere orientations space. Putting these values in
% relation it becomes clear, that all the components are multiple times
% stronger than the uniform distribution. We may compute these factors by

volume(odf,ori,delta) ./ volume(uniformODF(odf.CS),ori,delta)

%%
% It is important to understand, that all these values above depend
% significantly from the chosen disorientation angle |delta|. If |delta| is
% chosen too large

delta = 40*degree
volume(odf,ori,delta)*100

%%
% it may even happen that the components overlap and the sum of the volumes
% exceeds 100 percent.
%
%% Non circular components
%
% A disadvantage of the approach above is that one is restricted to
% circular components with a fixed disorientation angle which makes it hard
% to analyze components that are close together. In such settings one may
% want to use the command <SO3Fun.calcComponents.html |calcComponents|>. This
% command starts with evenly distributed orientations and lets the crawl
% towards the closest prefered orientation. At the end of this process the
% command returns these prefered orientation and the percentage of
% orientations that crawled to each of them.

[ori, vol] = calcComponents(odf);
ori
vol * 100

%%
% These volumes allways sums up to apprximately 100 percent. While the
% prefered orientations should be the same as those computed by the |max|
% command.

annotate(ori,'MarkerFaceColor','red')
