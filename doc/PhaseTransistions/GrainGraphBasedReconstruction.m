%% Setting up the parent grain reconstructor
% 
% Grain reconstruction is guided in MTEX by a variable of type
% <parentGrainReconstructor.parentGrainReconstructor.html
% |parentGrainReconstructor|>. During the reconstruction process this class
% keeps track about the relationship between the measured child grains and
% the recovered parent grains.

% set up the job
job = parentGrainReconstructor(ebsd,grains);

%%
% The |parentGrainReconstructor| guesses from the EBSD data what is the
% parent and what is the child phase. If this guess is not correct it might
% be specified explicitely by defining an initial guess for the parent to
% child orientation relationship first and passing it as a third argument to
% |<parentGrainReconstructor.parentGrainReconstructor.html
% parentGrainReconstructor>|. Here we define this initial guess seperately
% as the Kurdjumov Sachs orientation relationship

% initial guess for the parent to child orientation relationship
job.p2c = orientation.KurdjumovSachs(job.csParent, job.csChild)
%job.p2c = orientation.NishiyamaWassermann(job.csParent, job.csChild)

%%
% The output of the variable |job| tells us the amount of parent and child
% grains as well as the percentage of already recovered parent grains.
% Furthermore, it displays how well the current guess of the parent to
% child orientation relationship fits the child to child misorientations
% within our data. In our sample data set this fit is described by the 4
% quintiles 2.5°, 3.5°, 4.5° and 5.5°.
%
%% Optimizing the parent child orientation relationship
%
% It is well known that the phase transformation from austenite to
% martensite is not described by a fixed orientation relationship. In fact,
% the actual orientation relationship needs to be determined for each
% sample individualy. Here, we used the iterative method proposed by Tuomo
% Nyyssönen and implemented in the function <calcParent2Child.html
% |calcParent2Child|> that starts at our initial guess of the orientation
% relation ship and iterates towards a more optimal orientation
% relationship.

close all
histogram(job.calcGBFit./degree,'BinMethod','sqrt')
xlabel('disorientation angle')

job.calcParent2Child

%%
% We observe that the optimized parent to child orientation relationship is
% 2.3° off the initial Kurdjumov Sachs orientation relationship
% and reduced the first quintil of the misfit with the child to child
% misorientations to 1.5°. These misfits are stored by the
% command <calcParent2Child.html |calcParent2Child|> in the variable
% |job.fit|. In fact, the algorithm assumes that the majority of all
% boundary misorientations are child to child misorientations and finds the
% parent to child orientations relationship by minimizing this misfit. The
% following histogram displays the distribution of the misfit over all
% grain to grain misorientations.

histogram(job.calcGBFit./degree,'BinMethod','sqrt')
hold off

%%
% We may explicitely compute the misfit for all child to child
% boundaries using the command <parentGrainReconstructor.calcGBFit.html
% |calcGBFit|>. Beside the list |fit| it returns also the list of grain
% pairs for which these fits have been computed. Using th command
% <grainBoundary.selectByGrainId.html |selectByGrainId|> we can find the
% corresponding boundary segments and colorize them according to this
% misfit. In the code below we go one step further and adjust the
% transparency as a function of the misfit.

% compute the misfit for all child to child grain neighbours
[fit,c2cPairs] = job.calcGBFit;

% select grain boundary segments by grain ids
[gB,pairId] = job.grains.boundary.selectByGrainId(c2cPairs);

% plot the child phase
plot(ebsd('Iron bcc'),ebsd('Iron bcc').orientations,'figSize','large','faceAlpha',0.5)

% and on top of it the boundaries colorized by the misfit
hold on;
% scale fit between 0 and 1 - required for edgeAlpha
plot(gB, 'edgeAlpha', (fit(pairId) ./ degree - 2.5)./2 ,'linewidth',2);
hold off

%% Graph based parent grain reconstruction
%
% Next we set up a graph where each edge describes two neighbouring grains
% and the value of this edge is the probability that these two grains
% belong to the same parent grain. This graph is computed by the function
% <parentGrainReconstructor.calcGraph.html |calcGraph|>. The probability
% is computed from the misfit of the misorientation between the two child
% grains to the theoretical child to child misorientation. More precisely,
% we model the probability by a cumulative Gaussian distribution with the
% mean value |'threshold'| which describes the misfit at which the
% probability is exactly 50 percent and the standard deviation
% |'tolerance'|.

job.calcGraph('threshold',2.5*degree,'tolerance',2.5*degree);

%% 
% We may visualize th graph adjusting the edgeAlpha of the boundaries
% between grains according to the edge value of the graph. This can be
% accomplished by the command <parentGrainReconstructor.plotGraph.html
% |plotGraph|>

plot(ebsd('Iron bcc'),ebsd('Iron bcc').orientations,'figSize','large','faceAlpha',0.5)
hold on;
job.plotGraph('linewidth',2)
hold off

%%
% The next step is to cluster the graph into components. This is done by
% the command <parentGrainReconstructor.clusterGraph.html |clusterGraph|>
% which uses by default the Markovian clustering algorithm. The number of
% clusters can be controlled by the option |'inflationPower'|. A smaller
% inflation power results in fewer but larger clusters.

job.clusterGraph('inflationPower',1.6)

%%
% Finaly, we assume a single parent orientation for each cluster and use it
% to compute a parent orientation for each child grain beeing part of a
% cluster. This is done by the command
% <parentGrainReconstructor.calcParentFromGraph.html
% |calcParentFromGraph|>.

% compute parent orientations
job.calcParentFromGraph

% plot them
plot(job.parentGrains,job.parentGrains.meanOrientation)

%%
% We observe that almost all child grains have been fliped into parent
% grains. The command <parentGrainReconstructor.calcParentFromGraph.html
% |calcParentFromGraph|> has two additional outputs. The misorientation
% angle between the reconstructed parent orientation of each child grain
% and the mean parent orientation of the corresponding parent grain is 
% stored in |job.grains.fit| while |job.grains.clusterSize| containes the
% size of each cluster.

%%
% We may use these quantities to undo the parent orientation reconstruction
% for child grains with a misfit exeeding a certain threshold or belonging
% to a too small cluster. This can be done by the command
% <parentGrainReconstructor.revert.html |job.revert|> 

job.revert(job.grains.fit > 5*degree | job.grains.clusterSize < 15)

%%
% When used without any input argument
% <parentGrainReconstructor.revert.html |job.revert|> will undo all
% reconstructed parent grain. This is helpfull when experimenting with
% different parameters.
%
% In order to fill the holes corresponding to the remaining child grains we
% inspect their misorientations to neighbouring already reconstructed
% parent grains. Each of these misorientations votes for a certain parent
% orientation. We choose the parent orientation that gets the most votes.
% The corresponding commands <parentGrainReconstructor.calcGBVotes.html
% |job.calcGBVotes|> and <parentGrainReconstructor.calcParentFromVote.html
% |job.calcParentFromVote|> can be adjusted by many options.

for k = 1:3 % do this three times

%% Merge similar grains and inclusions
%
% We observe that we have many neighbouring parent grains with similar
% orientations. These can be merged into big parent grains using the
% command <parentGrainReconstructor.mergeSimilar.html |mergeSimilar|>

% merge grains with similar orientation
job.mergeSimilar('threshold',7.5*degree);

% plot the result
plot(job.parentGrains,job.parentGrains.meanOrientation)

%%
% We may be still a bit unsatisfied with the result as the large parent
% grains contain many poorly indexed inclusions where we failed to assign
% to a parent orientation. We may use the command
% <parentGrainReconstructor.mergeInclusions.html |mergeInclusions|> to
% merge all inclusions with fever pixels then a certain threshold into the
% surrounding parent grains.

job.mergeInclusions('maxSize',50);

% plot the result
plot(job.parentGrains,job.parentGrains.meanOrientation)

%% Compute Child Variants
% 
% Knowing the parent grain orientations we may compute the variants and
% packets of each child grain using the command
% <parentGrainReconstructor.calcVariants.html |calcVariants|>. The values
% are stored with the properties |job.transformedGrains.variantId| and
% |job.transformedGrains.packetId|. The |packetId| is defined as the
% closest {111} plane in austenite to the (011) plane in martensite.

% associate to each packet id a color and plot
color = ind2color(job.transformedGrains.packetId);

hold off

%%
% We can also directly identify the child grains belonging to the selected
% parent grains. Remeber that the initial grains are stored in
% |job.grainsPrior| and that the vector |job.mergeId| stores for every
% initial grain the |id| of the corresponding parent grain. Combining these
% two information we do

% identify childs of the selected parent grain
childGrains = job.grainsPrior(job.mergeId == grainSelected.id);

%% Parent EBSD reconstruction
%
% So far our analysis was at the grain level. However, once parent grain
% orientations have been computed we may also use them to compute parent
% orientations of each pixel in our original EBSD map. This is done by the
% command <parentGrainReconstructor.calcParentEBSD.html |calcParentEBSD|>
