% This script demonstrates the tools MTEX offers to reconstruct a parent
% austenite phase from a measured martensite phase. The methods are
% described in more detail in the publications 
%
% * <https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02103 The variant graph approach to
% improved parent grain reconstruction>, arXiv, 2022,

% We shall use the following sample data set.

% load the data
mtexdata martensite 
plotx2east

% grain reconstruction
[grains,ebsd.grainId] = calcGrains(ebsd('indexed'), 'angle', 3*degree);

% remove small grains
ebsd(grains(grains.grainSize < 3)) = [];

% reidentify grains with small grains removed:
[grains,ebsd.grainId] = calcGrains(ebsd('indexed'),'angle',3*degree);
grains = smooth(grains,5);

% plot the data and the grain boundaries
plot(ebsd('Iron bcc'),ebsd('Iron bcc').orientations,'figSize','large')

plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)

%% Setting up the parent grain reconstructor
% 
% Grain reconstruction is guided in MTEX by a variable of type
% <parentGrainReconstructor.parentGrainReconstructor.html
% |parentGrainReconstructor|>. During the reconstruction process this class
% keeps track about the relationship between the measured child grains and
% the recovered parent grains.

% set up the job
job = parentGrainReconstructor(ebsd,grains);

%%
% The |parentGrainReconstructor| guesses from the EBSD data what is the
% parent and what is the child phase. If this guess is not correct it might
% be specified explicitely by defining an initial guess for the parent to
% child orientation relationship first and passing it as a third argument to
% |<parentGrainReconstructor.parentGrainReconstructor.html
% parentGrainReconstructor>|. Here we define this initial guess seperately
% as the Kurdjumov Sachs orientation relationship

% initial guess for the parent to child orientation relationship
job.p2c = orientation.KurdjumovSachs(job.csParent, job.csChild)
%job.p2c = orientation.NishiyamaWassermann(job.csParent, job.csChild)

%%
% The output of the variable |job| tells us the amount of parent and child
% grains as well as the percentage of already recovered parent grains.
% Furthermore, it displays how well the current guess of the parent to
% child orientation relationship fits the child to child misorientations
% within our data. In our sample data set this fit is described by the 4
% quintiles 2.5°, 3.5°, 4.5° and 5.5°.
%
%% Optimizing the parent child orientation relationship
%
% It is well known that the phase transformation from austenite to
% martensite is not described by a fixed orientation relationship. In fact,
% the actual orientation relationship needs to be determined for each
% sample individualy. Here, we used the iterative method proposed by Tuomo
% Nyyssönen and implemented in the function <calcParent2Child.html
% |calcParent2Child|> that starts at our initial guess of the orientation
% relation ship and iterates towards a more optimal orientation
% relationship.

close all
histogram(job.calcGBFit./degree,'BinMethod','sqrt')
xlabel('disorientation angle')

job.calcParent2Child

%%
% We observe that the optimized parent to child orientation relationship is
% 2.3° off the initial Kurdjumov Sachs orientation relationship
% and reduced the first quintil of the misfit with the child to child
% misorientations to 1.5°. These misfits are stored by the
% command <calcParent2Child.html |calcParent2Child|> in the variable
% |job.fit|. In fact, the algorithm assumes that the majority of all
% boundary misorientations are child to child misorientations and finds the
% parent to child orientations relationship by minimizing this misfit. The
% following histogram displays the distribution of the misfit over all
% grain to grain misorientations.

hold on
histogram(job.calcGBFit./degree,'BinMethod','sqrt')
hold off

%%
% We may explicitely compute the misfit for all child to child
% boundaries using the command <parentGrainReconstructor.calcGBFit.html
% |calcGBFit|>. Beside the list |fit| it returns also the list of grain
% pairs for which these fits have been computed. Using th command
% <grainBoundary.selectByGrainId.html |selectByGrainId|> we can find the
% corresponding boundary segments and colorize them according to this
% misfit. In the code below we go one step further and adjust the
% transparency as a function of the misfit.

% compute the misfit for all child to child grain neighbours
[fit,c2cPairs] = job.calcGBFit;

% select grain boundary segments by grain ids
[gB,pairId] = job.grains.boundary.selectByGrainId(c2cPairs);

% plot the child phase
plot(ebsd('Iron bcc'),ebsd('Iron bcc').orientations,'figSize','large','faceAlpha',0.5)

% and on top of it the boundaries colorized by the misfit
hold on;
% scale fit between 0 and 1 - required for edgeAlpha
plot(gB, 'edgeAlpha', (fit(pairId) ./ degree - 2.5)./2 ,'linewidth',2);
hold off

%% Variant Graph based parent grain reconstruction
%
% Next we set up the variant graph where the nodes are the potential parent
% orientations of each child grain and the edges describe neighbouring
% grains that have compatible potential parent orientations. This graph is
% computed by the function <parentGrainReconstructor.calcVariantGraph.html
% |calcVariantGraph|>. The edge weights are computed from the misfit
% between the potential parent orientations using a cumulative Gaussian
% distribution with the mean value |'threshold'| which describes the misfit
% at which the probability is exactly 50 percent and the standard deviation
% |'tolerance'|.

job.calcVariantGraph('threshold',2.5*degree,'tolerance',2.5*degree)

%%
% For large maps it can be useful to perform the segmentation in a two step
% process, where in the in the first step similarly oriented variants are
% reconstructed as one variants and only seperated in a second step. This
% can be accomplished by the commands
% 
%   job.calcVariantGraph('threshold',2.5*degree,'tolerance',2.5*degree,'mergeSimilar')
%   job.clusterVariantGraph 
%   job.calcVariantGraph('threshold',2.5*degree,'tolerance',2.5*degree)
%
%%
% The next step is to cluster the variant graph into components. This is
% done by the command <parentGrainReconstructor.clusterVariantGraph.html
% |clusterVariantGraph|>.

job.clusterVariantGraph('includeSimilar')

%%
% As a result a table of votes |job.votes| is generated. More specificaly,
% |job.votes.prob| is a matrix that contains in row |job.votes.prob(i,:)|
% the probabilities of the i-th child grain to have a specific parent
% orientation. Accordingly, we can plot the probability of the best fit for
% each grain by

plot(job.grains,job.votes.prob(:,1))
mtexColorbar

%%
% We observe many child grains where the algorithm is sure about the parent
% orientation and some child grains where the probability is close to 50
% percent. This is an indication that there are a least two potential
% parent orientations which are similarly likely. In many cases these
% potential parent orientations are in a twinning relationship.
%
% Lets reconstruct all parent orientations where the probability is above
% 50 percent.

job.calcParentFromVote('minProb',0.5)

% plot the result
plot(job.parentGrains,job.parentGrains.meanOrientation)

%%
% From here we have different possibilities to continue. One possibility is
% to reconstruct the remaining parent orientations manually. To this end
% one can use the the command
% <parentGrainReconstructor.selectInteractive.html
% |job.selectInteractive|>. This allow to click any grain and to change its
% parent orientation into one of the potential parent orientations.

job.selectInteractive

%%
% A second way would be to rerun the variant graph approach above a second
% time but with relaxed settings, i.e., with a lower probability. A third
% way is to use the command <parentGrainReconstructor.calcGBVotes.html
% |job.calcGBVotes|> to compute votes for potential parent orientations
% from the surrounding already reconstructed parent grains. 

% compute the votes
job.calcGBVotes('p2c','reconsiderAll')

% assign parent orientations according to the votes
job.calcParentFromVote

% plot the result
plot(job.parentGrains,job.parentGrains.meanOrientation)

%% Merge similar grains and inclusions
%
% After the above reconstruction steps most of the child grains have been
% reverted into parent grains. However, instead of a few big parent grains
% we still have many small, but similarly oriented parent grains. These can
% be merged into big parent grains using the command
% <parentGrainReconstructor.mergeSimilar.html |mergeSimilar|>

% merge grains with similar orientation
job.mergeSimilar('threshold',7.5*degree);

% plot the result
plot(job.parentGrains,job.parentGrains.meanOrientation)

%%
% We may be still a bit unsatisfied with the result as the large parent
% grains contain many poorly indexed inclusions where we failed to assign
% to a parent orientation. We may use the command
% <parentGrainReconstructor.mergeInclusions.html |mergeInclusions|> to
% merge all inclusions with fever pixels then a certain threshold into the
% surrounding parent grains.

job.mergeInclusions('maxSize',50);

% plot the result
plot(job.parentGrains,job.parentGrains.meanOrientation)

%% Compute Child Variants
% 
% Knowing the parent grain orientations we may compute the variants and
% packets of each child grain using the command
% <parentGrainReconstructor.calcVariants.html |calcVariants|>. The values
% are stored with the properties |job.transformedGrains.variantId| and
% |job.transformedGrains.packetId|. The |packetId| is defined as the
% closest {111} plane in austenite to the (011) plane in martensite.

job.calcVariants

% associate to each packet id a color and plot
color = ind2color(job.transformedGrains.packetId);
plot(job.transformedGrains,color,'faceAlpha',0.5)

hold on
parentGrains = smooth(job.parentGrains,10);
plot(parentGrains.boundary,'linewidth',3)

% outline a specific parent grain
grainSelected = parentGrains(parentGrains.findByLocation([100,80]));

hold on
plot(grainSelected.boundary,'linewidth',3,'lineColor','w')
hold off

%%
% We can also directly identify the child grains belonging to the selected
% parent grains. Remeber that the initial grains are stored in
% |job.grainsPrior| and that the vector |job.mergeId| stores for every
% initial grain the |id| of the corresponding parent grain. Combining these
% two information we do

% identify childs of the selected parent grain
childGrains = job.grainsPrior(job.mergeId == grainSelected.id);

% plot these childs 
plot(childGrains,childGrains.meanOrientation)

% and top the parent grain boundary 
hold on
plot(grainSelected.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off

%% 
% In order to check our parent grain reconstruction we chose the single
% parent grain outlined in the above map and plot all child variants of its
% reconstructed parent orientation together with the actually measured
% child orientations inside the parent grain. In order to compute the
% |variantId| and |packetId| we use the command <calcVariantId.html
% |calcVariantId|>.

%% Parent EBSD reconstruction
%
% So far our analysis was at the grain level. However, once parent grain
% orientations have been computed we may also use them to compute parent
% orientations of each pixel in our original EBSD map. This is done by the
% command <parentGrainReconstructor.calcParentEBSD.html |calcParentEBSD|>

parentEBSD = job.calcParentEBSD;

% plot the result
plot(parentEBSD('Iron fcc'),parentEBSD('Iron fcc').orientations,'figSize','large')

%%
% We obtain even a measure |parentEBSD.fit| for the corespondence between
% the parent orientation reconstructed from the single pixel and the parent
% orientation of the grain. Lets visualize this fit

% the fit between ebsd child orientation and the reconstructed parent grain
% orientation

%% Denoise the parent map
%
% Finaly we may apply filtering to the parent map to fill non indexed or
% not reconstructed pixels. To this end we first run grain reconstruction
% on the parent map
