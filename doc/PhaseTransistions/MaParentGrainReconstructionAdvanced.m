%% Determine the parent child orientation relationship
% It is well known that the phase transformation from austenite to
% martensite is not described by a fixed orientation relationship. In fact,
% the actual orientation relationship needs to be determined for each
% sample individualy. Here, we used the iterative method proposed by Tuomo
% Nyyssönen and implemented in the function <calcParent2Child.html
% |calcParent2Child|> that starts at an initial guess of the orientation
% relation ship and iterates towards the true orientation relationship.
%
% Here we use as the initial guess the Kurdjumov Sachs orientation
% relationship

% initial gues is Kurdjumov Sachs
KS = orientation.KurdjumovSachs(csFCC,csBCC);

%%
% The function <calcParent2Child.html |calcParent2Child|> requires as input
% a list of child to child misorientations or, equivalently, a two column
% matrix of child orientations. Here we go with the second option and setup
% this two column orientation matrix from the mean orientations of
% neighbouring grains which can be found using the command
% <grain2d.neighbours.html |neighbours|>

% get neighbouring grain pairs
grainPairs = grains.neighbors;

% ignore pairs with misorientation angle smaller then 5 degree
mori = grains(grainPairs).meanOrientation;
grainPairs(angle(mori(:,1),mori(:,2)) < 5*degree,:) = [];

% compute an optimal parent to child orientation relationship
[fcc2bcc, fit] = calcParent2Child(grains(grainPairs).meanOrientation,KS);

%%
% Beside the optimized parent to child orientation relationship the command
% <calcParent2Child.html |calcParent2Child|> returns as a second output
% argument the misfit between all grain to grain misorientations and the
% theoretical child to child misorientations. In fact, the algorithm
% assumes that the majority of all boundary misorientations are child to
% child misorientations and finds the parent to child orientations
% relationship by minimizing this misfit. The following histogram displays
% the distribution of the misfit over all grain to grain misorientations.

close all
histogram(fit./degree)
xlabel('disorientation angle')

%%
% We may also colorize the grain boundaries according to this misfit. To
% this end we first compute the relationship between pairs of grains
% |grainPairs| and the boundary segments stored in |grains.boundary| using
% the command <grainBoundary.selectByGrainId.html |selectByGrainId|>

[gB,pairId] = grains.boundary.selectByGrainId(grainPairs);

% abd then pass the variable |fit| as second input argument to the

% We observe that the boundary segments with a large misfit form large

% grains.

%% Create a similarity matrix
%
% Next we set up a adjacency matrix |A| that describes the probability that
% two neighbouring grains belong to the same parent grains. This
% probability is computed from the misfit of the misorientation between two
% child grains to the theoretical child to child misorientation. More
% precisely, we model the probability by a cumulative Gaussian distribution
% with the mean value |threshold| which describes the misfit at which the
% probability is exactly 50 percent and the standard deviation |tol|

omega = linspace(0,5)*degree;
threshold = 2*degree;
tol = 1.5*degree;

% The above diagram describes the probability distribution as a function of
% the misfit. After filling the matrix |A| with these probabilities

% compute the probabilities
prob = 1 - 0.5 * (1 + erf(2*(fit - threshold)./tol));

% the corresponding similarity matrix
A = sparse(grainPairs(:,1),grainPairs(:,2),prob,length(grains),length(grains));

%%
% we can split it into clusters using the command <calcCluster.html
% |calcCluster|> which implements the <https://micans.org/mcl Markovian
% clustering algorithm>. Here an important parameter is the so called
% inflation power, which controls the size of the clusters. 

p = 1.6; % inflation power:
A = mclComponents(A,p);

%%
% Each connected component of the resulting adjacency matrix describes one
% parent grain. Hence, we can use this adjacency matrix to merge child
% grains into parent grains by the command <graind2d.merge.html |merge|>.

% merge grains according to the adjacency matrix A
[parentGrains, parentId] = merge(grains,A);

% important to have the parent grains already at their optimal size.

%% Compute parent grain orientations
% In the next step we compute for each parent grain its parent austenite
% orientation. This can be done usig the command <calcParent.html
% |calcParent|>. Note, that we ensure that at least two child grains have
% been merged and that the misfit is smaller than 5 degree.

%% Compute Child Variants
% 
% Knowing the parent grain orientations we may compute the <|variantId|> of
% each child grain using the command <calcVariantId.html
% |calcVariantId|>. As a bonus this command returns also the
% |packetId|, here defined as the closest {111} plane in austenite to the
% (011) plane in martensite.

%% Summary of relevant thresholds

% In the above script several parameters are decisive for the success of
% the reconstruction
%
% * threshold for initial grain segmentation (3 degree)
% * theshold (2 degree), tolerance (1.5 degree) and inflation power (p =
% 1.6) of the Markovian clustering algorithm
% * maximum misfit within a parent grain (5 degree)
% * minimum number of merged child grains

%% Triple Point Based Analysis
%
% A problem of the boundary based reconstuction algorithm is that often
% child variants of different grains have a misorientation that is close to
% the theoretical child to child misorientation. One idea to overcome this
% problem is to analyze triple junctions. Now all three child orientations
% must fit to a common parent orientations. This fit is computed by the
% command <calcParent.html |calcParent|>.

% extract child orientations at triple junctions
tP = grains.triplePoints;
tPori = grains(tP.grainId).meanOrientation;

% compute the misfit to a common parent orientation
[~, fit] = calcParent(tPori,fcc2bcc,'id','threshold',5*degree);

% accordingly.

% Again we observe, that triple junctions with large misfit outline the
% shape of the parent grains. In order to identify these parent grains we
% proceed analogously as for the boundary based analysis. We first set up a
% similarity matrix between grains connected to the same triple points and
% than use the Markovian clustering algorithm to detect clusters of child
% grains, which are than merged into parent grains.
