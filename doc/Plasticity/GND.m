%
% Lets start by importing orientation data from 2 percent uniaxial deformed
% steel DC06 and visualize those data in an ipf map.

% set up the plotting convention
plotx2north

% import the EBSD data
ebsd = EBSD.load([mtexDataPath filesep 'EBSD' filesep 'DC06_2uniax.ang']);
%ebsd = EBSD.load('DC06_2biax.ang');

% define the color key
ipfKey = ipfHSVKey(ebsd);
ipfKey.inversePoleFigureDirection = yvector;

% and plot the orientation data
plot(ebsd,ipfKey.orientation2color(ebsd.orientations),'micronBar','off','figSize','medium')

%%
% In the next step we reconstruct grains, remove all grains with less then
% 5 pixels and smooth the grain boundaries.


% reconstruct grains
[grains,ebsd.grainId] = calcGrains(ebsd,'angle',5*degree);

% remove small grains
ebsd(grains(grains.grainSize<=5)) = [];

% redo grain reconstruction
[grains,ebsd.grainId] = calcGrains(ebsd,'angle',2.5*degree);

% smooth grain boundaries
grains = smooth(grains,5);

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off

%% Data cleaning
% The computation of geometrically neccesary dislocations from EBSD maps
% depends on local orientation changes in the map. In order to make those
% visible we switch to a different color key that colorises the
% misorientation of an pixel with respect to the grain meanorientation.

% a key the colorizes according to misorientation angle and axis
ipfKey = axisAngleColorKey(ebsd);

% set the grain mean orientations as reference orinetations
ipfKey.oriRef = grains(ebsd('indexed').grainId).meanOrientation;

% plot the data
plot(ebsd('indexed'),ipfKey.orientation2color(ebsd('indexed').orientations),'micronBar','off','figSize','medium')

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off

%% 
% We observe that the data are quite noisy. As noisy orientation data lead
% to overestimate the GND density we apply sime denoising techniques to the
% data.

% denoise orientation data
F = halfQuadraticFilter;

ebsd = smooth(ebsd('indexed'),F,'fill',grains);

% plot the denoised data
ipfKey.oriRef = grains(ebsd('indexed').grainId).meanOrientation;
plot(ebsd('indexed'),ipfKey.orientation2color(ebsd('indexed').orientations),'micronBar','off','figSize','medium')

hold on
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2)
hold off

%% The incomplete curvature tensor
% Starting point of any GND computation is the curvature tensor, which is a
% rank two tensor that is defined for every pixel in the EBSD map by the
% directional derivatives in x, y and z direction.

% consider only the Fe(alpha) phase 
ebsd = ebsd('indexed').gridify;

% compute the curvature tensor
kappa = ebsd.curvature

% one can index the curvature tensors in the same way as the EBSD data.
% E.g. the curvature in pixel (2,3) is
kappa(2,3)

%% The components of the curvature tensor
% As expected the curvature tensor is NaN in the third column as this
% column corresponds to the directional derivative in z-direction which is
% usually unknown for 2d EBSD maps. 
%
% We can access the different components of the curvature tensor with

kappa12 = kappa{1,2};

size(kappa12)

%%
% which results in a variable of the same size as our EBSD map. This allows
% us to visualize the different components of the curvature tensor

newMtexFigure('nrows',3,'ncols',3);

% cycle through all components of the tensor
for i = 1:3
  for j = 1:3
    
    nextAxis(i,j)
    plot(ebsd,kappa{i,j},'micronBar','off')
    hold on; plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2); hold off
    
  end
end

% unify the color rage  - you may also use setColoRange equal
setColorRange([-0.005,0.005])
drawNow(gcm,'figSize','large')


%% The incomplete dislocation density tensor
% According to Kroener the curvature tensor is directly related to the
% dislocation density tensor. 

alpha = kappa.dislocationDensity

%%
% which has the same unit as the curvature tensor and is incomplete as well
% as we can see when looking at a particular one.

alpha(2,3)

%% Crystallographic Dislocations
% The central idea of Pantleon is that the dislocation density tensor is
% build up by single dislocations with different densities such that the
% total energy is minimum. Depending on the attomic lattice different
% dislocattion systems have to be considered. In present case of a body
% centered cubic (bcc) material 48 edge dislocations and 4 screw
% dislocations have to be considered. Those principle dislocations are
% defined in MTEX either by their Burgers and line vectors or by

dS = dislocationSystem.bcc(ebsd.CS)

%%
% Here the norm of the Burgers vectors is important

% size of the unit cell
a = norm(ebsd.CS.aAxis);

% in bcc and fcc the norm of the burgers vector is sqrt(3)/2 * a
[norm(dS(1).b), norm(dS(end).b), sqrt(3)/2 * a]


%% The Energy of Dislocations
% The energy of each dislocation system can be stored in the property |u|.
% By default this value it set to 1 but should be changed accoring to the
% specific model and the specific material.
%
% According to Hull & Bacon the energy U of edge and screw dislocations is
% given by the formulae
%
% $$ U_{\mathrm{screw}} = \frac{Gb^2}{4\pi} \ln \frac{R}{r_0} $$
%
% $$ U_{\mathrm{edge}} = (1-\nu) U_{\mathrm{screw}} $$
%
% where
% 
% * |G| is 
% * |b| is the length of the Burgers vector
% * |nu| is the Poisson ratio
% * |R|
% * |r|
%
% In this example we assume 
% 
% R = 
% r_0 = 
% U = norm(dS.b).^2

nu = 0.3;

% energy of the edge dislocations
dS(dS.isEdge).u = 1;

% energy of the screw dislocations
dS(dS.isScrew).u = 1 - 0.3;

% Question to verybody: what is the best way to set the enegry? I found
% different formulae
%
% E = 1 - poisson ratio
% E = c * G * |b|^2,  - G - Schubmodul / Shear Modulus Energy per (unit length)^2

%%
% A single dislocation causes a deformation that can be represented by
% the rank one tensor

dS(1).tensor

%%
% Note that the unit of this tensors is the same as the unit used for
% describing the length of the unit cell, which is in most cases Angstrom
% (au). Furthremore, we observe that the tensor is given with respect to
% the crystal reference frame while the dislocation densitiy tensors are
% given with respect to the specimen reference frame. Hence, to make them
% compatible we have to rotate the dislocation tensors into the specimen
% reference frame as well. This is done by

dSRot = ebsd.orientations * dS


%% Fitting Dislocations to the incomplete dislocation density tensor
% Now we are ready for fitting the dislocation tensors to the dislocation
% densitiy tensor in each pixel of the map. This is done by the command
% <curvatureTensor.fitDislocationSystems.html fitDislocationSystems>.

[rho,factor] = fitDislocationSystems(kappa,dSRot);

%%
% As result we obtain a matrix of densities |rho| such that the product
% with the dislocation systems yields the incomplete dislocation density
% tensors derived from the curvature, i.e.,

% the restored dislocation density tensors 
alpha = sum(dSRot.tensor .* rho,2);

% we have to set the unit manualy since it is not stored in rho
alpha.opt.unit = '1/um';

% the restored dislocation density tensor for pixel 2
alpha(2)

% the dislocation density dervied from the curvature in pixel 2
kappa(2).dislocationDensity

%%
% we may also restore the complete curvature tensor with

kappa = alpha.curvature 

%%
% and plot it as we did before

newMtexFigure('nrows',3,'ncols',3);

% cycle through all components of the tensor
for i = 1:3
  for j = 1:3

    nextAxis(i,j)
    plot(ebsd,kappa{i,j},'micronBar','off')
    hold on; plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',2); hold off

  end
end

setColorRange([-0.005,0.005])
drawNow(gcm,'figSize','large');


%% The total dislocation energy 
% The unit of the densities |h| in our example is 1/um * 1/au where 1/um
% comes from the unit of the curvature tensor an 1/au from the unit of the
% Burgers vector. In order to transform |h| to SI units, i.e., 1/m^2 we
% have to multiply it with 10^16. This is exactly the values returned as
% the second output |factor| by the function
% <curvatureTensor.fitDislocationSystems.html fitDislocationSystems>.
  
factor

%% 
% Multiplying the densities |rho| with this factor and the individual
% energies of the the dislocation systems we end up with the total
% dislocation energy. Lets plot this at a logarithmic scale
