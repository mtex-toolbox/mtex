%% Lankford parameter
%
% The Lankford parameter, also referred to as the Lankford coefficient, the
% R-value or plastic strain ratio, is an important material property in the
% field of mechanical metallurgy, particularly in the study of sheet metal
% forming processes. It is often used to optimize manufacturing processes,
% especially in industries like automotive and aerospace, where sheet metal
% components are extensively utilized.
% 
% The Lankford parameter quantifies the anisotropy of a material's plastic
% deformation behavior. It is the ratio of the true width strain to the
% true thickness strain at a particular value of length strain. This scalar
% quantity is used extensively as an indicator of formability.
% 
% R-values can vary widely depending on the material and its processing
% history:
%
% * Materials with high R-values, typically ranging from ~1 to 2.5 
%   or higher, exhibit a strong degree of anisotropy in their deformation 
%   behavior. This means they deform significantly more in one direction 
%   compared to perpendicular directions. 
%
% * Alternatively, materials with low R-values, typically close to zero or 
%   even slightly negative, exhibit more isotropic deformation 
%   characteristics such that they tend to deform relatively uniformly in 
%   all directions.
%
% The R-value is highly relevant to forming operations:
%
% * Materials with high R-values are often preferred for forming processes.
%   This is because they exhibit a strong tendency to elongate in one 
%   direction while constraining deformation in the perpendicular 
%   directions. This can lead to improved formability and allows for more 
%   complex shapes to be produced without causing defects like cracks or 
%   wrinkles.
%
% * On the other hand, materials with low R-values may be less suitable for
%   certain forming operations. Since they tend to be less anisotropic, it
%   results in more uniform deformation but that in turn may limit the 
%   complexity of shapes that can be produced without defects.
%
% Understanding the R-value of a material is crucial in sheet metal forming
% processes as it helps manufacturers select the right material for a
% specific application.
% 
% For example, in the automotive industry, materials with high R-values are 
% often chosen for parts like car body panels, where complex shapes are 
% common. 
%
% On the other hand, materials with lower R-values may be more suitable for
% applications where uniformity of deformation is critical. An example is
% the production of deep drawn parts, such as cylindrical containers or
% cans. In deep drawing, a flat sheet of metal is formed into a
% three-dimensional shape by being drawn into a die cavity. This process
% requires uniform deformation of the material to avoid wrinkles, or uneven
% thickness distribution (thinning) in areas around the drawn part.
% Consequently, materials with lower r-values, which exhibit more isotropic
% deformation behavior, are better suited for deep drawing applications
% since they are less likely to show preferential deformation in one
% direction. Instead, they are more likely to deform uniformly in all
% directions, ensuring a consistent shape is produced.
% 
% To experimentally calculate the Lankford parameter, uniaxial tensile 
% tests at different angles to the rolling direction are required. The 
% R-value is then calculated as the ratio of the transverse strain 
% (i.e. - perpendicular to the loading direction) to the axial strain 
% (i.e. - along the loading direction).
%
% In the context of crystallography and electron backscattering diffraction
% (EBSD) analysis, understanding the Lankford parameter is crucial for 
% predicting how a material will deform under different loading conditions. 
% 
% In terms of MATLAB and the MTEX toolbox, the the Lankford parameter or 
% R-value is modelled or estimated on the basis of crystallographic 
% orientations and the Taylor theory as demonstrated below.

%% Example 1: The Lankford parameter (or R-value) of a single orientation
%
% In this example, a single (1 1 0)[1 -1 2] Brass orientation is used.

% define an fcc crystal system
CS = crystalSymmetry('m-3m', [1 1 1], 'mineral', 'fcc');

% define the fcc slip system
b = Miller(1,-1,0,CS,'uvw'); % slip direction
n = Miller(1,1,-1,CS,'hkl'); % slip plane normal
sS = slipSystem(b,n);

% use MTEX's pre-defined (1 1 0)[1 -1 2] Brass orientation
ori = orientation.brass(CS);

% compute the Lankford parameter
[R, M, minM] = calcLankford(ori,sS,'verbose');

%%
% The summary results show that for the Brass orientation, it is not always
% possible to predict the R-value as Inf values are predicted at 45° and 
% 90° to the nominal rolling direction (or in this case, x). 
%
% The computed Taylor factor allows us to recreates Fig. 3.10 on page 74
% of: [William F. Hosford, The mechanics of crystals and textured
% polycrystals]
% (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/crat.2170290414) It
% shows the dependence of $M$ on $\rho = -d_{\epsilon}_Y / d_{\epsilon}_X =
% \frac{R}{1+R}$ for rolling and transverse direction tension tests for an
% ideal Brass orientation. In the rolling direction test, x = [1 -1 2], and
% in the transverse test x = [-1 1 1].

%% Example 2: The Lankford parameter (or R-value) of an ebsd map
% In this demonstration an hcp titanium dataset is used

% load an mtex ebsd map
mtexdata titanium

% define the crystal system
CS = ebsd.CS;

% reconstruct the grains
[grains,ebsd.grainId] = calcGrains(ebsd,'angle',5*degree);

% remove small grains
ebsd(grains(grains.grainSize <= 5)) = [];

% recalculate the grains
[grains,ebsd.grainId] = calcGrains(ebsd,'angle',5*degree);

% plot the orientations
plot(ebsd,ebsd.orientations);
hold all
plot(grains.boundary,'lineWidth',2);
hold off

%% define the hcp slip systems
% Since Taylor theory is used to compute the Lankford parameter, multiple
% slip systems and their corresponding critical resolved shear stresses
% <slipSystem.index.html slip systems> can be employed.

sS = [slipSystem.basal(CS,1),...
  slipSystem.prismatic2A(CS,66),...
  slipSystem.pyramidalCA(CS,80),...
  slipSystem.twinC1(CS,100)]

%% compute the Lankford parameter
% The Lankford parameter is computed using the command <calcLankford.html
% |calcLankford|>. It solely depends on the texture provided by the mean
% orientations of the grains, weighted by the area of the grains and the
% angle $\theta$ between the tensile direction and the rolling direction.
% In the case of the latter, the default reference direction is $x$.

theta = linspace(0,90*degree,19);
[R, M, minM] = calcLankford(grains.meanOrientation,sS,theta,'weights',grains.grainSize,'verbose');

%%

odf = calcODF(grains.meanOrientation,'weights',grains.grainSize,'verbose');

[R, M, minM] = calcLankford(odf,sS,theta);

%%
% The following plot shows the Lankford parameter, as a function
% of the angle $\theta$ between the tensile direction and the notional 
% rolling direction (in this case - x).

clf
plot(theta ./ degree,R,'o-r','lineWidth',1.5);
xlabel('Angle to tensile direction, {\theta} (in degrees)');
ylabel('R @ M_m_i_n, R = {\rho} / (1 - {\rho}) = -d{\epsilon}_Y / d{\epsilon}_Z');

%%
% Similarly, the next plot shows the Taylor factor as a function of the 
% angle $\theta$ between the tensile direction and the notional 
% rolling direction (in this case - x).

plot(theta ./ degree,minM,'o-b','lineWidth',1.5);
xlabel('Angle to tensile direction, {\theta} (in degrees)');
ylabel('Min. relative strength, min(M) = min({\sigma}_x / {\tau}min(M))');

%%
% The R-value can also be used to compute two additional values that are of
% importance to sheet metal operations:
%
% * The normal anisotropy ratio (Rbar, or Ravg, or rm) defines the ability 
%   of the metal to deform in the thickness direction relative to 
%   deformation in the plane of the sheet. For Rbar values >= 1, the sheet 
%   metal resists thinning, improves cup drawing, hole expansion, and other
%   forming modes where metal thinning is detrimental. For Rbar < 1, 
%   thinning becomes the preferential metal flow direction, increasing the 
%   risk of failure in drawing operations.

Rbar = 0.5 * (R(1) + R(19) + 2*R(10))

%%
% * A related parameter is the planar anisotropy parameter (deltaR) which 
%   is an indicator of the ability of a material to demonstrate non-earing
%   behavior. A deltaR value = 0 is ideal for can-making or deep drawing of
%   cylinders, as this indicates equal metal flow in all directions; thus
%   eliminating the need to trim ears during subsequent processing.

deltaR = 0.5 * (R(1) + R(19) - 2*R(10))
