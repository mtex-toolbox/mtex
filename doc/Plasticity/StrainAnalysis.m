%% Taylor model

% consider Basal slip
sS = slipSystem.fcc(ebsd.CS)

% and all symmetrically equivalent variants
sS = sS.symmetrise;

% consider plane strain
q = 0.5;
eps = strainTensor(diag([-q 1 -(1-q)]));

% and compute Taylor factor as well as the active slip systems
[M,b,W] = calcTaylor(inv(grains.meanOrientation).*eps,sS);

%%

% find the maximum 
[~,id] = max(b,[],2);

%%
% The variable |id| contains now for each grain the id of the slip system
% with the largest Schmidt factor. In order to visualize it we first rotate
% for each grain the slip system with largest Schmid factor in specimen
% coordinates

sSGrain = grains.meanOrientation .* sS(id)

% and plot then the plance normal and the Burgers vectors into the centers
% of the grains
