%% Texture evolution in rolled magnesium during uniaxial tension
%
% This examples models the texture evolution of rolled magnesium under
% unixaxial tension using the Taylor model. The undeformed material is
% assumed to have a basal fibre texture perpendicular to tension direction.
% Then tension experiment has been performed twice: at room temperature and
% at 250 degree Celcius. The strain at fracture was approx. 30 percent and
% 70 percent, respectively.

%% Setting up hexagonal crystal symmetry
% First we need to set up hexagonal crystal symmetry.

cs = crystalSymmetry.load('Mg-Magnesium.cif')
cs = cs.properGroup;

%% Setting up the basal fibre texture
% 
% Second, we set up the initial fibre texture which has the c-axis
% perpendicular to the (x,y)-sheet plane and the a-axes are randomized.
% This is typical for rolled Mg-sheet

odf = fibreODF(cs.cAxis, vector3d.Z);
%odf = uniformODF(cs)


%% Plot polefigures of generated initial state without strains
% define crystal orientations of interest for polefigures and plot figure

h = Miller({0,0,0,1},{1,0,-1,0},{1,0,-1,1},cs);

pfAnnotations = @(varargin) text([-vector3d.X,vector3d.Y],{'Tension','TD'},...
  'BackgroundColor','w','tag','axesLabels',varargin{:});
setMTEXpref('pfAnnotations',pfAnnotations);
plotPDF(odf,h,'antipodal','contourf','figSize','small')
mtexColorbar;

%% Setting up the slip systems
%
% The critical resolved shear stresses (CRSS) needed to activate certain
% slip systems is temperature AND material dependant. As it is not trivial
% to measure/define CRSS, there are many different values in literature.
%
% In practise, at room temperature basal slip dominates and commonly simple
% tension twins are activated as well (they have very low CRSS). During
% tension stress perpendicular to the c-axis tension twinning cannot occur.
% Thats why it is sensible to only define compression twins (which in Mg
% have a very high CRSS)

% second argument is CRSS normalized to basal slip
sScold = [slipSystem.basal(cs,1),...
  slipSystem.prismatic2A(cs,66),...
  slipSystem.pyramidalCA(cs,80),...
  slipSystem.twinC1(cs,100)];

% consider all symmetrically equivlent slip systems
[sScold,slipId] = sScold.symmetrise;

%%
% At higher temperatures the CRSS of non-basal slip systems decreases.

% second argument is CRSS normalized to basal slip
sSwarm = [slipSystem.basal(cs,1),...
  slipSystem.prismatic2A(cs,15),...
  slipSystem.pyramidalCA(cs,10),...
  slipSystem.twinC1(cs,100)];

% consider all symmetrically equivlent slip systems
sSwarm = sSwarm.symmetrise;

%% Defining strain tensors
% Due to constant volume law, the sum of all strains must equal zero. Here
% slightly anisotropic strain is assumed at room temperature, with more
% thinning in y-direction than in z-direction. In practise the anisotropy
% of Mg at high temperatures becomes negligible.

epsCold = 0.3 * strainTensor(diag([1 -0.6 -0.4]))
epsWarm = 0.7 * strainTensor(diag([1 -0.5 -0.5]))

%% Calculate texture evolution
% The Tayor calculation is used to get the resulting spin of each vector as
% well as the coeffeicients for each slip system for cold and hot state

% simulated an initial orientation distribution of 10000 grains
ori = odf.discreteSample(100000);

% apply the Taylor model 
[~,bCold,WcoldD] = calcTaylor( inv(ori) .* epsCold, sScold);
[~,bWarm,WwarmD] = calcTaylor( inv(ori) .* epsWarm, sSwarm);

%%
% Apply the Taylor spin to the initial orientation distribution

oriCold = ori .* orientation(-WcoldD);
oriWarm = ori .* orientation(-WwarmD);

oriWarm2 = ori .* orientation(-Wwarm.eval(ori));
