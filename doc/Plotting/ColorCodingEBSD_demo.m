%% Colorcoding of orientations
%
% In order to visualize orientation maps as they are measured by EBSD one
% has to assign a color to each possible orientation. As an example one may
% think of representing an orientation by its Euler angles ph1, Phi, phi2
% and taking these as the RGB values of a color. Of course there are many
% other ways to do this. Before presenting all the possibilities MTEX
% offers to assign a color to each orientation let us shortly summmarize
% what properties we expect from such an assignment.
%
% # crystallographic equivalent orientations should have the same color
% # similar orientations should have similar colors
% # different orientations should have different colors
% # the whole colorspace should be used for full contrast
% # if the orientations are concentrated in a small region of the
% orientation space, the colorspace should be exhaust by this region
% 
% It should be noted that it is impossible to have all the 4 points mentioned above
% represented by a single colorcoding. This is mainly due the fact that 
% the orientation space is three dimensional and the colorspace is only two dimensional, 
% i.e., there are to few colors to cover the whole orientation space in a unambiguous
% way. Hence, some compromises has to be accepted and some assumptions have to be made.
%
%
%% Assigning the Euler angles to the RGB values
% Using the Euler angles as the RGB values is probably the most simplest
% way of mapping an orientation to a color. In MTEX such a color map is
% defined as a variable of type <orientationMapping.html orientatiomMapping>

% we have to set up a crystal symmetry first, as it defines the fundamental
% region for the Euler angles
cs = crystalSymmetry('432')

% thise defins the orientation map
oM = BungeRGBOrientationMapping(cs)

%%
% Given an arbitrary orientation

ori = orientation('Euler',10*degree,20*degree,0*degree)

%%
% we can compute the corresponding color as rgb values by

rgb = oM.orientation2color(ori)

%%
% Lets visuallize the orientation map by plotting it in orientation space
% as phi_2 sections

plot(oM,'sections',6,'phi2')


%%
% Although this visualization looks very smooth, the orientation map using
% Euler angles introduces lots of color jumps, i.e., the point 2 of our
% requirement list is not satisfied. This becomes obvious when plotting the
% colors as sigma sections, i.e., when section according to phi_1 - phi_2

plot(oM,'sections',6,'sigma')


%% Colorcoding according to inverse pole figure 
%
% The standard way of mapping orientations to colors is based on inverse
% pole figures. The following orientation map assignes a color to each
% direction of the fundamental sector of the inverse pole figure

oM = ipdfHSVOrientationMapping(cs)

plot(oM)

%%
% We may also look at the inverse pole figure sphere in 3d. One can nicely
% observe how the color map follows the given symmetry group.

close all
plot(oM,'3d')

%%
% Alternatively we may plot the color mapping in 2d on the entire sphere
% together with the symmetry elements

plot(oM,'complete')

hold on
plot(cs)
hold off


%%
% The orientation map provides several options to alter the alignment of
% the colors. Lets give some examples

% we may interchange green and blue by setting
oM.colorPostRotation = reflection(yvector);

plot(oM)

%%
% or shift the cycle of colors red, green, blue by
oM.colorPostRotation = rotation('axis',zvector,'angle',120*degree);

plot(oM)


%%
% Lets now consider an EBSD map

mtexdata forsterite

plot(ebsd)

%%
% and asume we want to colorize the Forsterite phase according to its
% orientation. Then we first define the orientation mapping.
% Note that we can pass the phase we want to color instead of the crysta
% symmetry

oM = ipdfHSVOrientationMapping(ebsd('Forsterite'))

%%
% We may also want to set the inverse pole figure direction. This is done by

oM.inversePoleFigureDirection = zvector;

%%
% Next we compute the color corresponding to each orientation we want to
% plot.

color = oM.orientation2color(ebsd('Forsterite').orientations);

%%
% Finally, we can use these colors to visuallize the orientations of the
% Forsterite phase

plot(ebsd('Forsterite'),color)

%%
% We can visuallize the orientations of the forsterite phase also the other
% way round by plotting them into the inverse pole figure map.

plot(oM)

hold on
plotIPDF(ebsd('Forsterite').orientations,oM.inversePoleFigureDirection,...
  'MarkerSize',4,'MarkerFaceColor','none','MarkerEdgeColor','k')
hold off

%%
% Since orientations measured by EBSD devices are pure rotations specified by
% its Euler angles, we may restrict the crystal symmetry group to pure
% rotations as well. As this group is smaller in general the corresponding
% fundamental sector is larger, which allows to distinguish more rotations

% this restricts the crystal symmetries used for visualization
% to proper rotations
ebsd('Forsterite').CS = ebsd('Forsterite').CS.properGroup;
oM = ipdfHSVOrientationMapping(ebsd('Forsterite'))

%
plot(oM)

%% 
% We observe that the fundamental sector is twice as large as for the
% original crystal symmetry. Furthermore, the meassured Euler angles are
% not symmetric within this enlarged fundamental sector

hold on
plotIPDF(ebsd('Forsterite').orientations,oM.inversePoleFigureDirection,...
  'MarkerSize',4,'MarkerFaceColor','none','MarkerEdgeColor','k')
hold off

%%
% Lets finish this example by plotting the ebsd map of the Forsterite
% orientations color mapped according to this restricted symmetry group.
% The advantage of restricting the symmetry group is that we can
% distinguish more grains.

color = oM.orientation2color(ebsd('Forsterite').orientations);

plot(ebsd('Forsterite'),color)
