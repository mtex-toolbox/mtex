%% Spherical Projections
%
%%
% MTEX supports four types of spherical projection which are available for
% all spherical plot, e.g. <SO3Fun.plotPDF.html polefigure plots>,
% <SO3Fun.plotIPDF.html inverse polefigure plots> or <SO3Fun.plotSection.html
% ODF plots>. These are the equal area projection (Schmidt projection), the
% equal distance projection, the stereographic projection (equal angle
% projection), the three-dimensional projection and the flat projection.
%
% In order to demonstrate the different projections we start by defining a
% model ODF.

cs = crystalSymmetry('321');
odf = fibreODF(Miller(1,1,0,cs),zvector)


%% Alignment of the Hemispheres
%
% *Partial Spherical Plots*
%
% If an ODF has triclinic specimen symmetry its pole figures differs in
% general on the upper hemisphere and the lower hemisphere. By
% default MTEX plots, in this case, both hemispheres. The upper on the
% left-hand side and the lower on the right-hand side.
% TODO: this is currently missing

plotPDF(odf,Miller(1,1,0,cs),'minmax')

%%
%
% MTEX allows also to plot only the upper or the lower hemisphere by
% passing the options |upper| or |lower|.

plotPDF(odf,Miller(1,1,0,cs),'lower','minmax')

%%
% Due to Friedel's law measured pole figures are a superposition of the
% upper and the lower hemisphere (since antipodal directions are
% associated). In order to plot pole figures as a superposition of the
% upper and lower hemisphere one has to enforce <VectorsAxes.html
% antipodal symmetry>. This is done by the option *antipodal*.

%% Alignment of the Coordinate Axes
%
% *Rotate and Flip Plots*
%
% Sometimes it is more convenient to have the coordinate system rotated or
% flipped in some way. For this reason, all plot commands in MTEX allows for
% the options *rotate*, *flipud* and *fliplr*. A more direct way for
% changing the orientation of the plot is to specify the direction of the
% x-axis by the commands <plotx2east.html plotx2east>, <plotx2north.html
% plotx2north>, <plotx2west.html plotx2west>, <plotx2south.html
% plotx2south>.

%% Equal Area Projection (Schmidt Projection)
%
% Equal area projection is defined by the characteristic that it preserves
% the spherical area. Since pole figures are defined as relative frequency
% by area equal area projection is the default projection in MTEX. In can
% be set explicitly by the flags *earea* or *schmidt*.

%% Equal Distance Projection
%
% The equal distance projection differs from the equal area projection by
% the characteristic that it preserves the distances of points to the
% origin. Hence it might be a more intuitive projection if you look at
% crystal directions.

cs = crystalSymmetry('m-3m');
plotHKL(cs,'projection','edist','upper','grid_res',15*degree,'BackGroundColor','w')

%% Stereographic Projection (Equal Angle Projection)
%
% Another famous spherical projection is the stereographic projection
% which preserves the angle between arbitrary great circles. It
% can be chosen by setting the option *stereo* or *eangle*.

plotHKL(cs,'projection','eangle','upper','grid_res',15*degree,'BackGroundColor','w')

%% Plain Projection
%
% *Plain* means that the polar angles theta / rho are plotted in a simple
% rectangular plot. This projection is often chosen for ODF plots, e.g.

plot(SantaFe,'alpha','sections',18,'resolution',5*degree,...
  'projection','plain','contourf','FontSize',10,'silent')
mtexColorMap white2black


%% Three-dimensional Plots
%
% MTEX also offers a three-dimensional plot of pole figures which even
% might be rotated freely in space
