%% Ambiguity of the Pole Figure to ODF Reconstruction Problem
% 
%%
% This page demonstrates different sources of ambiguity when reconstructing
% an ODF from pole figure diffraction data.
%
%% The ambiguity due to too few pole figures
%
% Due to experimental limitations, one is usually restricted to a short list
% of crystal directions (Miller indices) for which diffraction pole figures
% can be measured. In general, more measured pole figures implies more
% reliable ODF reconstruction and low-symmetry materials and weak textures
% usually requires more pole figures then sharp texture with a high
% crystal symmetry. From a theoretical point of view, the number of pole
% figures should be at a level with the square root of the number of pole
% points in each pole figure. This is of course far from experimentally
% possible.
%
% Let's demonstrate the ambiguity due to too few pole figures at the example
% of two orthorhombic ODFs. The first ODF has three modes at the positions

cs = crystalSymmetry('mmm');

orix = orientation.byAxisAngle(xvector,90*degree,cs);
oriy = orientation.byAxisAngle(yvector,90*degree,cs);
oriz = orientation.byAxisAngle(zvector,90*degree,cs);

odf1 = unimodalODF([orix,oriy,oriz])


%%
% The second ODF has three modes as well but this times at rotations about
% the axis (1,1,1) with angles 0, 120, and 240 degrees.

ori = orientation.byAxisAngle(vector3d(1,1,1),[0,120,240]*degree,cs);
odf2 = unimodalODF(ori)


%%
% These two ODFs are completely disjoint. Let's check this by plotting them
% as sigma sections

figure(1)
plot(odf1,'sigma')
mtexColorMap LaboTeX

figure(2)
plot(odf2,'sigma')
mtexColorMap LaboTeX

%%
% However, when it comes to pole figures 7 of them, namely, (100), (010),
% (001), (110), (101), (011) and (111), are identical for both ODFs. Of
% course looking at any other pole figure makes clear that those two ODFs
% are different.

figure(1)
h = Miller({1,0,0},{0,1,0},{0,0,1},{1,1,0},{1,0,1},{0,1,1},{1,1,1},{1,2,0},cs);
plotPDF(odf1,h,'contourf')
mtexColorMap LaboTeX

figure(2)
plotPDF(odf2,h,'contourf')
mtexColorMap LaboTeX

%%
% The question is now, how can any pole figure to ODF reconstruction
% algorithm decide which of the two ODFs was the true one if only the seven
% identical pole figures  (100), (010), (001), (110), (101), (011), (111)
% have been measured? The answer is: this is impossible to decide. Next
% question is: which result will I get from the MTEX reconstruction
% algorithm? Let's check this

% 1. step: simulate pole figure data
pf = calcPoleFigure(odf1,h(1:7),'upper');

plot(pf)

%%

% 2. step: reconstruct an ODF
odf = calcODF(pf,'silent')

plot(odf,'sigma')

%%
% We observe that the reconstructed ODF is an almost perfect mixture of the
% first and the second ODF. Actually, any mixture of the two initial ODFs
% would have been a correct answer. However, the ODF reconstructed by the
% MTEX algorithm can be seen as the ODF which is closest to the uniform
% distribution among all admissible ODFs.

%%
% Finally, we increase the number of pole figures by five more crystal
% directions and perform our previous experiment once again.

% 1. step: simulate pole figure data for all crystal directions
h = [h,Miller({0,1,2},{2,0,1},{2,1,0},{0,2,1},{1,0,2},cs)];
pf = calcPoleFigure(odf1,h,'upper');

% 2. step: reconstruct an ODF
odf = calcODF(pf,'silent')

plot(odf,'sigma')

%%
% Though the components of odf2 are still present in the recalculated
% ODF they are far less pronounced compared to the components of odf1.

% 1. step: simulate pole figure data for all crystal directions
pf = calcPoleFigure(odf1,h,'upper');

% 2. step: reconstruct an ODF
odf = calcODF(pf,'silent')

plot(odf,'sigma')

%% The ambiguity due to too Friedel's law
%
% Due to Friedel's law pole figure data always impose antipodal symmetry. In
% order to demonstrate the consequences of this antipodal symmetry we
% consider crystal symmetry -43m

cs = crystalSymmetry('-43m')

%%
% and two rotations

ori1 = orientation.byEuler(30*degree,60*degree,10*degree,cs)

ori2 = orientation.byEuler(30*degree,60*degree,100*degree,cs)

h = Miller({1,0,0},{1,1,0},{1,1,1},{1,2,3},cs);
plotPDF(ori1,h,'MarkerSize',12)
hold on
plotPDF(ori2,'MarkerSize',8)
hold off

%%
% Obviously, both orientations are not symmetrically equivalent as -43m
% does not have a four fold axis. This can also be seen from the pole
% figure plots above which are different for, e.g., (111). However, when
% looking at an arbitrary pole figure with additionaly imposed antipodal
% symmetry both orientations appears at exactly the same positions

plotPDF(ori1,h,'MarkerSize',12,'antipodal')
hold on
plotPDF(ori2,'MarkerSize',8)
hold off

%%
% The reason is that adding antipodal symmetry to all pole figures is
% equivalent to adding the inversion as an additional symmetry to the point
% group, i.e., to replace it by the Laue group. Which is illustrated in the
% following plot

ori1.CS= ori1.CS.Laue;
ori2.CS= ori2.CS.Laue;
h.CS = h.CS.Laue;

plotPDF(ori1,h,'MarkerSize',12)
hold on
plotPDF(ori2,'MarkerSize',8)
hold off


%%
% As a consequence of Friedels law, all noncentrosymmetric information about
% the texture is lost in the diffraction pole figures and we can only aim
% at recovering the centrosymmetric portion. In particular, any ODF that is
% reconstructed by MTEX from diffraction pole figures is centrosymmetric,
% i.e. its point group is a Laue group. If the point group of the crystal
% was already a Laue group then Fridel's law does not impose any additional
% ambiguity.

%%


%% The inherent ambiguity of the pole figure - ODF relationship
%
% Unfortunately, knowing all diffraction pole figures of an ODF is even for
% centrosymmetric symmetries not sufficient to recover the ODF unambiguously.
% To understand the reason for this ambiguity we consider triclinic
% symmetry and a week unimodal ODF with prefered orientation (0,0,0).

cs = crystalSymmetry('-1');

odf1 = 2/3 * uniformODF(cs) + 1/3 * unimodalODF(orientation.id(cs),'halfwidth',30*degree)

plotPDF(odf1,Miller({1,0,0},{0,1,0},{0,0,1},cs),'antipodal')

%%
% As any other ODF, we can represent it by its series expansion by harmonic
% functions. This does not change the ODF but only its representation

odf1 = FourierODF(odf1,10)

plotPDF(odf1,Miller({1,0,0},{0,1,0},{0,0,1},cs))

%%
% We may look at the coefficients of this expansion and observe how the
% decay to zero rapidly. This justifies to cut the harmonic expansion at
% harmonic degree 10.

%set(gca,'yScale','log')


%%
% Next, we define a second ODF which differs by the first one only in the
% odd order harmonic coefficients. More precisely, we set all odd order
% harmonic coefficients to zero

A = mod(1:11,2)';
odf2 = conv(odf1,A)

% pole figures of odf2.

%%
% and hence, it is impossible for any reconstruction algorithm to decide
% whether odf1 or odf2 is the correct reconstruction. In order to compare
% odf1 and odf2, we visualize them along the alpha fibre

% We obtain two completely different ODF: odf1 has a prefered orientation
% at (0,0,0) while odf2 has prefered orientations at all rotations about
% 180 degrees. These two ODFs have completely identical pole figures and
% hence, it is impossible by any reconstruction method to decide which of
% these two ODF was the correct one. It was the idea of Matthies to say
% that a physical meaningful ODF usually consists of a uniform portion and
% some components of prefered orientations. Thus in the reconstruction odf1
% should be prefered over odf2. The idea to distinguish between odf1 and
% odf2 is that odf1 has a larger uniform portion and hence maximizing the
% uniform portion can be used as a method to single out a physical meaningful
% solution.

%%
% Let's demonstrate this by the given example and simulate some pole figures
% out of odf2.

% When reconstruction an ODF from pole figure data MTEX automatically uses
% Matthies methods of maximizing the uniform portion called automatic ghost
% correction

odf_rec1 = calcODF(pf,'silent')

%%
% This method can be switched off by the following command
odf_rec2 = calcODF(pf,'noGhostCorrection','silent')


%%
% When comparing the reconstructed ODFs we observe that by using ghost
% correction we are able to recover odf1 quite nicely, while without ghost
% correction we obtain a mixture between odf1 and odf2.
