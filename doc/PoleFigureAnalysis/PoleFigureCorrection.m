%% Data Correction

%%
% In this section we discuss how to manipulate pole figure data, e.g., to
% correct for measurement errors. To illustrate lets start by importing
% some sample XRD data.

mtexdata geesthacht

% plot imported pole figure
plot(pf)


%% Splitting and Reordering of Pole Figures
% As we can see the first and the third pole figure complete pole figures
% and the second and the fourth pole figures contain some values for
% background correction. Let us, therefore, split the pole figures into
% these two groups. 

pf_complete = pf({1,3})
pf_background= pf({2,4})

%%
% Actually, it is possible to work with pole figures as with simple numbers.
% E.g. it is possible to add / subtract pole figures. A superposition of
% the first and the third pole figures can be written as

2*pf({1}) + 3*pf({3})


%% Correct pole figure data
%
% In order to correct pole figures for background radiation and
% defocusing one can use the command 
% <PoleFigure.correct.html correct>. In our case the syntax is

pf = correct(pf_complete,'background',pf_background);
plot(pf)

%% Normalize pole figures
%
% Sometimes people want to have normalized pole figures. In the case of
% complete pole figures, this can be simply archived using the command
% <PoleFigure.normalize.html normalize> 

pf_normalized = normalize(pf);
plot(pf_normalized)

%%
% However, in the case of incomplete pole figures, it is well known, that
% the normalization can only by computed from an ODF. Therefore, one has to
% proceed as follows:

% compute an ODF from the pole figure data
odf = calcODF(pf);

% and use it for normalization
pf_normalized = normalize(pf,odf);

plot(pf_normalized)


%% Modify certain pole figure values
% 
% As pole figures are usually experimental data they may contain outliers. In
% order to remove outliers from pole figure data one can use the function
% <PoleFigure.isOutlier.html isOutlier>. Here a simple example:

% Let us add 100 random outliers to the pole figure data
% First we select 100 random positions within the pole figures
ind = randperm(pf.length,100);

% Next we multiply the intensity at these positions by a random value
% between 3 and 4
factor = 3+rand(100,1);
pf(ind).intensities = pf(ind).intensities(:) .* factor;

% Let's check the result
plot(pf)

%%
% check for outliers
condition = pf.isOutlier;

% remove outliers
pf(condition) = [];

% plot the corrected pole figures
plot(pf)

%%
% Sometimes applying the above correction is not suffcient. Then it can
% help to repeat the outlier detection ones again

pf(pf.isOutlier) = [];
plot(pf)

%% Remove certain measurements from the data
% In the same way, as we removed the outlier one can manipulate and delete
% pole figure data by any criteria. Lets, e.g. cap all values that are
% larger than 500. 

% find those values
condition = pf.intensities > 500;

% cap the values in the pole figures
pf(condition).intensities = 500;

plot(pf)


%% Rotate pole figures
% Sometimes it is necessary to rotate the pole figures. In order to do this
% with MTEX one has first to define a rotation, e.e. by

% This defines a rotation around the x-axis about 100 degree
rot = rotation.byAxisAngle(xvector,100*degree);

%%
% Second, the command <PoleFigure_rotate rotate> can be used to rotate the
% pole figure data.
pf_rotated = rotate(pf,rot);
plot(pf_rotated,'antipodal')
