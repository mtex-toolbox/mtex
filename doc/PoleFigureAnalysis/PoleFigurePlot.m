%% Plotting of Pole Figures
%
%%
%
% This section describes various possibilities to visualize pole figure
% data. Lets start by loading some XRD data

mtexdata ptx

%% 
% By default MTEX plots pole figures by drawing a circle at every
% measurement position of a pole figure and coloring it corresponding to
% the measured intensity.

plot(pf)
mtexColorbar

%%
% MTEX tries to guess the right size of the circle in order to produce a
% pleasing result. However, you can adjust this size using the option *MarkerSize*.

plot(pf,'MarkerSize',4)
mtexColorbar

%% Contour Plots
% Some people like to have their raw pole figures to be drawn as contour
% plots. This feature is not yet generally supported by MTEX. Note that
% measured pole figure may be given at a very irregular grid which would
% make it necessary to interpolate before drawing contours. In this case,
% however, it seems to be more reasonable to first compute an ODF and than
% to draw contour plots of the recalculated pole figures.
%
% Nevertheless, MTEX offers basic contour plots in the case of regular
% measurement grids.

plot(pf,'contourf')
mtexColorbar

%%
% When drawing a colorbar next to the pole figure plots it is necessary
% to have the same color coding in all plots. This can be done as following

mtexColorbar % remove colorbars
setColorRange('equal');
mtexColorbar % add a single colorbar

%% Plotting Recalculated Pole Figures
%
% In order to draw recalculated one first needs to compute an ODF.

odf = calcODF(pf,'silent')

%%
% Now smooth pole figures can be plotted for arbitrary crystallographic directions.
