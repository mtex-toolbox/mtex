%% Pole Figure Tutorial
% Tutorial on x-ray and neutron diffraction data.

%% Open in Editor

%% Import diffraction data
% Click on <matlab:import_wizard('PoleFigure') Import pole figure data> to
% start the import wizard which is a GUI leading you throught the import of
% pole figure data. After finishing the wizard you will end with a script
% similar to the following one.

% This script was automatically created by the import wizard. You should
% run the whoole script or parts of it in order to import your data. There
% is no problem in making any changes to this script.

% *Specify Crystal and Specimen Symmetries*

% crystal symmetry
CS = crystalSymmetry('6/mmm', [2.633 2.633 4.8], 'X||a*', 'Y||b', 'Z||c');

% specimen symmetry
SS = specimenSymmetry('1');

% plotting convention
setMTEXpref('xAxisDirection','north');
setMTEXpref('zAxisDirection','outOfPlane');

% *Specify File Names*

% path to files
pname = '/home/hielscher/Downloads/mtexerrordefocusing';

% which files to be imported
fname = {...
  [pname '/ZnCuTi_Wal_50_5x5_PF_002_R.UXD'],...
  [pname '/ZnCuTi_Wal_50_5x5_PF_100_R.UXD'],...
  [pname '/ZnCuTi_Wal_50_5x5_PF_101_R.UXD'],...
  [pname '/ZnCuTi_Wal_50_5x5_PF_102_R.UXD'],...
  };

% defocusing
pname = '/home/hielscher/Downloads/mtexerrordefocusing';
fname_def = {...
  [pname '/ZnCuTi_defocusing_PF_002_R.UXD'],...
  [pname '/ZnCuTi_defocusing_PF_100_R.UXD'],...
  [pname '/ZnCuTi_defocusing_PF_101_R.UXD'],...
  [pname '/ZnCuTi_defocusing_PF_102_R.UXD'],...
  };

% *Specify Miller Indice*

h = { ...
  Miller(0,0,2,CS),...
  Miller(1,0,0,CS),...
  Miller(1,0,1,CS),...
  Miller(1,0,2,CS),...
  };

% *Import the Data*

% create a Pole Figure variable containing the data
pf = loadPoleFigure(fname,h,CS,SS,'interface','uxd');

% defocussing
pf_def = loadPoleFigure(fname_def,h,CS,SS,'interface','uxd');

% correct data
pf = correct(pf,'def',pf_def);

%% Plot Raw Data
% You should run the sript section wise to see how MTEX imports the pole
% figure data. Next you can plot your data

plot(pf)
annotate([xvector,yvector,zvector],'label',{'X','Y','Z'},'backgroundColor','w')

%%
% Make sure that the Miller indices are correctly assigned to the pole
% figures and that the alignment of the specimen coordinate system, i.e.,
% X, Y, Z is correct. In case of outliers or misanligned data you may want
% to correct you raw data. See <ModifyPoleFigureData.html how to modify
% pole figure data> for further information.
%
%% ODF Estimation
%
% Once your data are in a good shape, i.e. defocussing correction has been
% done and only few outliers are left you can step to reconstruct an ODF
% out of these data. This is done by the command <PoleFigure_calcODF.html
% calcODF>. 

odf = calcODF(pf,'silent')

%%
% Note that reconstructing an ODF from pole figure data is a severly ill
% posed problem, i.e., it does *not* provide an unique solution. A more
% troughout discussion on the ambiguity of ODF reconstruction from pole
% figure data can be found <PF2ODFAmbiguity.html here>. As a rule of thumb:
% as more pole figures you have and as more consistent you pole figure data
% are as better you reconstructed ODF will be.
%
% To check how well your reconstructd ODF fitts the measured pole figure
% data do

plotPDF(odf,pf.h)

%%
% Compare the recalculated pole figures with the measured data. 
% Quantitative measure for the fitting are the so called RP values. They
% can be computed by

calcError(odf,pf)

%%
% In case of a bad fitting you may want to tweak the reconstruction
% algorithm. See <PoleFigure2odf.html here> for more information.
