% that are internaly stored as <quaternion.quaternion.html quaternions>. An
% overview of different rotation representations by three dimensional
% vectors and their properties can be found in the section
% <RotationRepresentations.html Representations>.

%% Euler Angles
%
% One of the most common ways to describe a rotation is as three subsequent
% rotations about fixed axes, e.g., first around the z axis, second around
% the x axis and third again around the z. The corresponding rotational
% angles are commonly called Euler angles. Beside the most common |ZXZ|
% covention other choices of the axes are sometimes used. Sorted by
% popularity in the texture analysis community these are
%
% * Bunge (phi1,Phi,phi2)       - ZXZ
% * Matthies (alpha,beta,gamma) - ZYZ
% * Roe (Psi,Theta,Phi)
% * Kocks (Psi,Theta,phi)
% * Canova (omega,Theta,phi)
%
% The default Euler angle convention in MTEX are the Bunge Euler angles,
% with axes Z, X, and Z. The following command defines a rotation by its
% three Bunge Euler angles

rot = rotation.byEuler(30*degree,50*degree,10*degree)

%%
% Note that the angles needs to be multiplied with *degree* since all
% commands in MTEX expect the input in radiant. Furthermore, the order of
% the first and the third Euler angle are interchanged in comparison to
% standard notation for reasons explained <MTEXvsBungeConvention.html
% here>.
%
% In order to define a rotation by a Euler angle convention different to
% the default Euler angle convention you to specify the convention as an
% additional parameter, e.g.

rot = rotation.byEuler(30*degree,50*degree,10*degree,'Roe')

%%
% This does not change the way MTEX displays the rotation on the screen.
% The default Euler angle convention for displaying a rotation can be
% changed by the command <setMTEXpref.html setMTEXpref>, for a permanent
% change the <matlab:edit('mtex_settings.m') mtex_settings> should be
% edited. Compare

%% Axis angle parametrisation and Rodrigues Frank vector
%
% A very simple possibility to specify a rotation is to specify the
% rotation axis and the rotation angle.

rot = rotation.byAxisAngle(xvector,30*degree)

%%
% Conversely, we can extract the rotational axis and the rotation angle of
% a rotation by

rot.axis
rot.angle ./degree

%%
% Closely related to the axis angle parameterisation of a rotation is the
% Rodriguess Frank vector. 

R = rot.Rodrigues

%%
% This is the rotational axis scaled by $\tan \omega/2$, where $\omega$ is
% the rotational angle.
2 * atan(norm(R))./degree

%%
% We can also define a rotation by a Rodrigues Frank vector by

rotation.byRodrigues(R)


%% Rotation Matrix
%
% Another common way to represent rotations is by 3x3 matrices. The column
% of such a rotation matrix coincide with the new positions of the x, y and
% z vector after the rotation. For a given rotation we may compute the
% matrix by

M = rot.matrix

%%
% Conversely, we may define a rotation by its matrix with the command

rot = rotation.byMatrix(M)


%% Four vectors defining a rotation
%
% Another useful method to define a rotation is by describing how in acts
% on two given directions. More precisely, given four vectors u1, v1, u2,
% v2 there is a unique rotation |rot| such that |rot * u1 = v1| and |rot *
% u2 = v2|. E.g., to find the rotation the maps the x-axis onto the y-axis
% and keeps the z-axis we do

u1 = vector3d.X;
v1 = vector3d.Y;
u2 = vector3d.Z;
v2 = vector3d.Z;


rot = rotation.map(u1,v1,u2,v2)

%%
% The above definition require that the angle between u1 and u2 is the same
% as between v1 and v2. The function gives an error if this condition is
% not meet. If only two vectors are specified, then the rotation with the
% smallest angle is returned that rotates the first vector onto the second
% one.

rot = rotation.map(zvector,yvector)

%%
% More generaly, one can fit a rotation |rot| to a list of left and right
% vectors |l| and |r| such that |rot * l| is the best approximation of |r|.
% This is done by the function <rotation.fit.html |rotation.fit|>

% take five random left vectors
left = vector3d.rand(5);

% rotate them by rot and perturbe them a little bit
right = rot * left + 0.1 * vector3d.rand(1,5);

% recover the rotation rot
rotation.fit(left,right)


%% Radom Rotations
%
% MTEX offers several ways for generating random rotations. In the most 




%% Logarithm, Exponential Mapping, Spin Tensor
%
% TODO

S = spinTensor(rot)

rotation(S)

vector3d(S)

%%

v = log(rot)

rotation(exp(v))

%% Quaternions
%
% A last possibility to define a rotation is by <quaternion.quaternion.html
% quaternion coordinates> a, b, c, d.

q = quaternion(1,0,0,0)

rot = rotation(q)
