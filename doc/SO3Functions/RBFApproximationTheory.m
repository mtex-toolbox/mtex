%% RBF-Kernel Approximation from Discrete Data
%
%%
% On this page we consider the problem of determining the Radial Basis
% Function (@SO3FunRBF) of a smooth orientation dependent function
% $f(\mathtt{ori})$ given a list of orientations $\mathtt{ori}_m$ and a
% list of corresponding values $v_m$. These values may be the volume of
% crystals with a specific orientation, as in the case of an ODF, or any
% other orientation dependent physical property.
%
% A more general documentation about approximation of discrete data in MTEX
% can be found in the section <SO3FunApproximationTheory.html Approximating 
% Orientation Dependent Functions from Discrete Data>.
%
%%
% In general we should favor RBF-kernel approximation, if the data coincide
% to an underlying density function (odf,mdf,...) or if the number of data
% points (given rotations and function values) and the noise ratio are not
% too large.
%
%%
% In the following we take a look on the approximation problem from
% <SO3FunApproximationTheory.html general approximation theory>,
% where we compared the  harmonic approximation with kernel approximation.
%
% Here we additionally assume that our function values are noisy.

fname = fullfile(mtexDataPath, 'orientation', 'dubna.csv');
[ori, S] = orientation.load(fname,'columnNames',{'phi1','Phi','phi2','values'});

val = S.values + randn(size(S.values)) * 0.2 * std(S.values);

plotSection(ori,val,'all','sigma')

%%
% The basic strategy is to approximate the data by a |@SO3FunRBF|, see
% <RadialODFs.html Radial Basis Functions on SO(3)>.
%
% Hence we determine rotations $R_1,\dots,R_N$ and seek the corresponding 
% coefficients $\vec c=(c_1,\dots,c_N)$ such that
%
% $$ f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^N c_n \, \Psi(\cos\frac{\omega(x,R_n)}{2}) $$
% 
% approximates our data reasonable well. In this formula, $\Psi$ describes
% a <SO3Kernels.html SO(3)-Kernel Function>. Hence, $f$ is a superposition
% of one rotational kernel function centered on the orientations
% $R_1,\dots,R_N$ and weighted by the coefficients $c_1,\dots,c_N$.
% 
% A basic strategy is to apply least squares approximation, where we 
% compute the coefficients $c_n$ by minimizing the functional 
%
% $$ \sum_{m=1}^M|f(x_m)-v_m|^2 $$
%
% for the given data points $(x_m,v_m)$, $m=1,\dots,M$. Here $x_m$ denotes
% the given orientations and $v_m$ the corresponding function values.
%
% This least squares problem can also be written in matrix vector notation
% $ \mathrm{argmin}\limits_{c} \| K \cdot c - v \|, $
% where $c=(c_1,\dots,c_N)^T$, $v=(v_1,\dots,v_M)^T$ and $K$ is the kernel
% matrix $[\Psi(\cos\frac{\omega(x_m,R_n)}{2})]_{m,n}$.
%
% This least squares problem can be solved by the |lsqr| method from
% MATLAB, which efficiently seeks for roots of the derivative of the given
% functional (also known as normal equation).
%
% Alternatively there is also a modified least square method |mlsq|, which
% search for a solution $c_1,\dots,c_N$ that satisfies $c>0$ and 
% $\sum\limits_{n=1}^N c_n = 1$. This method can be used if the underlying
% function is a density, i.e. it is nonnegative and has mean 1.
%
%%
% In MTEX the command <rotation.interp.html |interp|> computes by default
% computes an approximation by a superposition of radial functions.

SO3F = interp(ori,val,'density')
plot(SO3F,'sigma')
mtexColorbar

%%
% The flag |'density'| tells MTEX to use the |mlsq| solver, which ensures
% that the resulting function is nonnegative and normalized to mean $1$.
% This yields also a denoising effect.

minValue = min(SO3F)
meanValue = mean(SO3F)

%%
% One has to keep in mind that we can not expect the error in the data
% nodes to be zero, because we compute a smooth function from the noisy
% input data.

norm(SO3F.eval(ori) - val) / norm(val)


%%
% In contrast, if we do not tell MTEX, that we try to approximate a density
% function, the solver has less information and the result is not denoised.

SO3F = interp(ori,val)
plot(SO3F,'sigma')
mtexColorbar

%%
% Hence the result is not automatically a density function (nonnegative and
% mean 1).

minValue = min(SO3F)
meanValue = mean(SO3F)

%%
% But since it is not denoised, it is overfitted and the error becomes small.

norm(SO3F.eval(ori) - val) / norm(val)

%% Adjustment of the Kernel Function
%
% The key parameter when approximating by radial basis functions is the
% halfwidth of the kernel function $\Psi$. This can be set by the option
% |'halfwidth'|. A large halfwidth results in a very smooth approximated
% function whereas a very small halfwidth - in relation to the grid of the
% input data - may result in overfitting. 

SO3F = interp(ori,val,'halfwidth',2*degree,'density')
plot(SO3F,'sigma')

%%
% A a rule of thumb the halfwidth of the kernel function should be at least
% the resolution of the data points. Note that the option 'halfwidth' also
% adjusts the resolution of the center orientation grid of the rotational
% kernel functions of the approximated |@SO3FunRBF|, i.e. the resolution of
% the grid of $R_1,\dots,R_N$ in the above formulas.
%
% We can preserve the resolution of this grid by adding the option
% |'resolution'|. Therefore we obtain a smoothed function of |SO3F1|.

SO3F = interp(ori,val,'halfwidth',10*degree,'resolution',5*degree,'density')
plot(SO3F,'sigma')

%%
% We can also input centers $R_1,\dots,R_N$ for the rotational kernel 
% functions by the option |'SO3Grid'|.

S3G = equispacedSO3Grid(crystalSymmetry,'resolution',5*degree)
SO3F = interp(ori,val,'SO3Grid',S3G,'density')
plot(SO3F,'sigma')

%%
% Lets study the effect of adjusting the kernel halfwidth to the error.

hw = [20,15,12.5,10,7.5,5,2.5];
err = zeros(size(hw));
for k = 1:numel(hw)
    SO3Fhw = interp(ori,val,'halfwidth',hw(k)*degree,'density');
    err(k) = norm(SO3Fhw.eval(ori) - S.values) / norm(S.values);
end

close all
plot(hw,err,'o--')
set(gca,'xdir','reverse')
xlabel('halfwidth [deg]')
ylabel('relative error')

%%
% We may find the best fit with a halfwidth of 7.5Â°. If the system is
% underdetermined using a too small halfwidth, we may not be able to fit
% kernel weights without additional assumptions about the smoothness of the
% data.

SO3F = interp(ori,val,'halfwidth',7.5*degree,'density')
plot(SO3F,'sigma')

%%
% Note that the option |'halfwidth'| tells MTEX to use the 
% |@SO3DeLaValleePoussinKernel| of this specific halfwidth. But we can also
% choose a different <SO3Kernels.html rotational kernel function> by the
% option |'kernel'|.

psi = SO3AbelPoissonKernel('halfwidth',5*degree)
SO3F = interp(ori,val,'kernel',psi,'density')
plot(SO3F,'sigma')

%% Exact Interpolation
%
% Assume, that our function values are not noisy. Then we may want to do
% exact interpolation, i.e. we want the error to be almost 0.
% 
% Up to now we used a special rotational grid for the centers of rotational 
% kernel function the approximated |@SO3FunRBF|.
% Now we can add the flag |'exact'| to use the input nodes as centers for 
% the rotational kernel functions. Therefore the kernel matrix $K$ becomes
% symmetric, positive definite and the above linear system $K\cdot c=v$ has
% a solution, i.e the error in lsqr may becomes 0.
% The disadvantage is that the kernel matrix is no longer sparse. Hence the
% computational costs may explode.

tic
SO3F = SO3FunRBF.interpolate(ori, S.values,'exact','halfwidth',7.5*degree);
toc
plot(SO3F,'sigma')

%%
% Note that future computations with this |@SO3FunRBF| are also very time 
% consuming, since most methods are faster if the center orientations 
% build a specific grid, which is not the case here.
%
% The interpolation is done by |lsqr|. Hence the error is dependent from 
% the termination conditions and not in machine precision.

norm(SO3F.eval(ori) - S.values) / norm(S.values)

%%
% Also, interpolation might not guarantee non-negativity of the function

minValue = min(SO3F)

%% LSQR-Parameters
%
% The |lsqr| solver and the |mlsq| solver, which are used to minimize the least
% squares problem from above has some predefined termination conditions.
% We can specify the method tolerance with the option |'tol'| 
% (default 1e-3) and the maximum number of iterations by the option 
% |'maxit'| (default 30/100).
%
% Thus we are able to control the precision of the result and computational 
% time of the least squares methods in the approximation process.
