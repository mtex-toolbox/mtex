%% Rotational Approximation and Interpolation
%
%%
% On this page, we want to cover the topic of function approximation from
% discrete values on the Rotation group. To simulate this, we have stored some
% nodes and corresponding function values which we can load. The csv-file
% contains the Euler angles $\phi_1$, $\Phi$ and $\phi_2$ of the nodes and the function
% value in the fourth column. Lets import these data using the function
% <orientation.load.html |load|> 

fname = fullfile(mtexDataPath, 'orientation', 'dubna.csv');
[nodes, S] = orientation.load(fname,'columnNames',{'phi1','Phi','phi2','values'});

%%
% The second output |S| is a struct that contains a field |S.values| with
% the function values from the fourth column. Next, we can make a section
% plot to see, what we are dealing with

plotSection(nodes, S.values,'all');

%%
% Now, we want to find a function which coincides with the given function
% values in the nodes reasonably well.

%% Interpolation
%
%%
% Interpolation is done by the <SO3Fun.interpolate |interpolate|> command
% of class <SO3Fun.SO3Fun |SO3Fun|> 

psi = SO3DeLaValleePoussinKernel('halfwidth',7.5*degree)
SO3F = SO3Fun.interpolate(nodes, S.values,'exact','kernel',psi);
plot(SO3F)

%% 
% The interpolation is done by lsqr. Hence the error is not in machine
% precision.
norm(SO3F.eval(nodes) - S.values) / norm(S.values)

%%
% If we don't restrict ourselfs to the given function values in the nodes, we have more
% freedom, which can be seen in the case of approximation.

%% Approximation
%
% In contrast to interpolation we are now not restricted to the function
% values in the nodes but still want to keep the error reasonably small.
%
%%
% One way is to interpolate the function similary as before, without the 
% option |'exact'|.
%
%%
% Another way is to approximate the rotational function with a series of 
% <WignerFunctions.html Wigner-D functions> (Harmonic series). 
% We don't take as many Wigner-D functions as there are nodes,
% such that we are in the overdetermined case. In that way we don't have a
% chance of getting the error in the nodes zero but hope for a smoother
% approximation. This can be achieved by the <SO3FunHarmonic.approximation |approximation|>
% command of the class <SO3FunHarmonic.SO3FunHarmonic |SO3FunHarmonic|> 

SO3F2 = SO3FunHarmonic.approximation(nodes, S.values);
plot(SO3F2)

%%
% Plotting this function, we can immidiately see, that we have a much
% smoother function. But one has to keep in mind that the error in the data
% nodes is not zero as in the case of interpolation.

norm(eval(SO3F, nodes) - S.values)

%%
% But this may not be of great importance like in the case of function
% approximation from noisy function values, where we don't know the exact
% function values anyways.

%%
%
% The strategy underlying the |approximation|-command
% to obtain such an approximation works via Wigner-D functions
% (<SO3FunHarmonicSeries Basics of rotational harmonics>). For that,
% we seek for so-called Fourier-coefficients ${\bf \hat f} = (\hat
% f^{0,0}_0,\dots,\hat f^{N,N}_N)^T$ such that
%
% $$ g(x) = \sum_{n=0}^N\sum_{k,l = -n}^n \hat f_n^{k,l} D_n^{k,l}(x) $$
%
% approximates our function. A basic strategy to achieve this is through
% least squares, where we minimize the functional 
%
% $$ \sum_{m=1}^M|f(x_m)-g(x_m)|^2 $$
%
% for the data nodes $x_m$, $m=1,\dots,M$, $f(x_m)$ the target function
% values and $g(x_m)$ our approximation evaluated in the given data nodes.
%
% This can be done by the |lsqr| function of Matlab, which efficiently
% seeks for roots of the derivative of the given functional (also known as
% normal equation). In the process we compute the matrix-vector product
% with the Fourier-matrix multible times, where the Fourier-matrix is given
% by
%
% $$ F = [D_n^{k,l}(x_m)]_{m = 1,\dots,M;~n = 0,\dots,N,\,k,l = -n,\dots,n}. $$
%
% This matrix-vector product can be computed efficiently with the use of
% the nonequispaced SO(3) Fourier transform
% <https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/nfft/nfsoft.php NSOFT>
% or faster by the combination of an Wigner-transform together with a 
% <https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/nfft/index.php NFFT>.
%
% We end up with the Fourier-coefficients of our approximation $g$, which
% describe our approximation.
%


%% Quadrature
%
% Assume we have some experiment which yields an ODF or some general 
% |@SO3Fun|, i.e. some evaluation routine. 

mtexdata dubna
odf = calcODF(pf,'resolution',5*degree,'zero_Range')

%%
% Now we want to compute the corresponding |@SO3FunHarmonic|.
% If our odf is an |@SO3Fun| or |@function_handle| we can directly use the command 
% <SO3FunHarmonic.html SO3FunHarmonic>.

F = SO3FunHarmonic(odf)

%%
% If there is an physical experiment which yields the function values for 
% given orientations, we can also do the quadrature manually.
%
% Therefore we have to evaluate on an specific grid and afterwards we compute the
% Fourier coefficients by the command <SO3FunHarmonic.quadrature.html SO3FunHarmonic.quadrature>.
%

% Specify the bandwidth and symmetries of the desired harmonic odf
N = 50;
SRight = odf.CS;
SLeft = specimenSymmetry;

% Compute the quadrature grid and weights
SO3G = quadratureSO3Grid(N,'ClenshawCurtis',SRight,SLeft);
% Because of symmetries there are symmetric equivalent nodes on the quadrature grid.
% Hence we evaluate the routine on a smaller unique grid and reconstruct afterwards.
% For SO3Fun's this is done internaly by evaluation.
tic
v = odf.eval(SO3G);
toc
% Analogously we can do exactly the same by directly evaluating on the 
% unique nodes of the quadratureSO3Grid
%v = odf.eval(SO3G.uniqueNodes);
% and reconstruct the full grid (of symmetric values) afterwards
%v = v(SO3G.uniqueIndexes);

% At the end we do quadrature
F1 = SO3FunHarmonic.quadrature(SO3G,v)
% or analogously
% F = SO3FunHarmonic.quadrature(SO3G.nodes,v,'weights',SO3G.weights,'bandwidth',N,'ClenshawCurtis')

%%
% Lets take a look on the result

norm(F-F1)

plot(F1)


%%
% Furthermore, if the evaluation step is very expansive it might be a good idea
% to use the smaller Gauss-Legendre quadrature grid. 
% The Gauss-Legendre quadrature lattice has half as many points as the default
% Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature lattice. But the quadrature method is much 
% more time consuming.
%

% Compute the quadrature grid and weights
SO3G = quadratureSO3Grid(N,'GaussLegendre',SRight,SLeft);
% Evaluate your routine on that quadrature grid
tic
  v = odf.eval(SO3G);
toc
% and do quadrature
F2 = SO3FunHarmonic.quadrature(SO3G,v)

norm(F-F2)
