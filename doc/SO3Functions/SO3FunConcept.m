%% Orientation Dependent Functions
%
%%
% An orientation dependent function is a function that assigns to each
% rotation or orientation a numerical value. An import example of a
% rotational function is the <ODFTheory.html orientation density function
% (ODF)> that assignes to each crystal orientation the probability of its
% occurence within a specimen. Other examples are the Schmidt or the Taylor
% factor as a function of the crystal orientation.
%
%% Definition of a orientation dependent function
%
% Within MTEX a rotational function is represented by a variable of type
% <SO3Fun.SO3Fun.html |SO3Fun|>. Let us consider as an example the function
% that takes an orientation and returns it rotational angle modulo cubic
% crystal symmetry. In MTEX the rotational angle is computed by the command
% <orientation.angle.html |angle(ori)|>. In order to turn this
% correspondence into a |SO3Fun| we use the command @SO3FunHandle and pass
% the angle command as an
% <https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/anonymous-functions.html
% anonymous function>.

% define the crystal symmetry
cs = crystalSymmetry('432');

% construct the SO3Fun
SO3F = SO3FunHandle(@(ori) angle(ori) ./ degree, cs)

%% 
% Many more methods for defining orientation dependent functions are
% discussed <SO3FunDefinition.html here>. 
% 
%%
% The entire information abot the orientation dependent function is now
% stored in the variable |SO3F|. In order to determine its value for a
% specific orientation |ori| the function <SO3Fun.eval.html |eval(ori)|> is
% used

ori = orientation.rand(cs)
SO3F.eval(ori)

%% Plotting an orientation Dependent Function
% 
% Orientation dependent functions are most of visualized by sections
% according to the third Euler angle $\varphi_2$
% 

plotSection(SO3F)

%%
% The plot tells us for which Euler angles the the resulting rotational
% angle is large and for which Euler angles it is low. The plot of this
% "angle function" |SO3F| becomes trivial if represented in an axis angle
% sections

plotSection(SO3F,'axisAngle','upper')
mtexColorbar
mtexColorMap parula

%%
% as obviously, the function value is constant in each section. 
% Many more methods for visualizing orientation dependent functions are
% discussed <SO3FunVisualization.html here>. 
% 
%% Computing with orientation dependent functions
%
% The power of representing an orientation dependent functions as a
% variables of type @SO3Fun is that we may apply to it a
% <SO3FunOperations.html large number of analysis tools>. In particular,
% one can add, subtract and mutiply orientation dependent functions, plot
% them in various projections or detect the local minima or maxima. In the
% case of our example function the local maxima refers to the orientations
% with maximum rotational angle in cubic symmetry. We may compute them by
% the command <SO3Fun.max.html |max|>

[value,ori] = max(SO3F,'numLocal',10,'accuracy',0.001*degree)

%%
% We observe that there are exactly six symetrically not equivalent
% orientations that realize an orientation angle of about 62.994 degree and
% form the vertices of the fundamental region in orienation space

color = ind2color(repmat(1:length(ori),numSym(cs),1));
plot(ori.symmetrise,color,'axisAngle','filled','markerSize',20,'restrict2FundamentalRegion')

%% Representations of Rotational Functions
%
% Internally MTEX represents rotational functions in different ways:
%
% || by a harmonic series expansion || <SO3FunHarmonicRepresentation.html SO3FunHarmonic> ||
% || as superposition of radial function || <RadialODFs.html SO3FunRBF> ||
% || as superposition of fibre elements || <FibreODFs.html SO3FunCBF> ||
% || as Bingham distribution || <BinghamODFs.html SO3FunBingham> ||
% || as sum of different components || @SO3FunComposition ||
% || explicitely given by a formula || @SO3FunHandle ||
%
% All representations allow the same operations which are specified for
% the abstact class |@SO3Fun|. In particular it is possible
% to calculate with $SO(3)$ functions as with ordinary numbers, i.e., you
% can add, multiply arbitrary functions, take the mean, integrate them or
% compute gradients, see <SO3FunOperations.html Operations>.
