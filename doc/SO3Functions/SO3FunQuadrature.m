%% Approximation of Orientation Dependent Functions
%
%%
% Assume we have given some evaluation routine $f$ that maps orientations 
% to numbers. This could be an rotational function of class |@SO3Fun|, 
% a |@function_handle|, a more complex Matlab function or a physical
% experiment.
% 
% On this page we will explain how to compute the corresponding 
% |@SO3FunHarmonic| and |@SO3FunRBF| that approximates $f$ reasonable well.
%
%%
% This approximation process is similarly to <SO3FunApproximation.html 
% Approximating Orientation Dependent Functions from Discrete Data>.
% where the given data are a set of orientations with function values.
%
%%
% Lets load an orientation dependent function as @SO3Fun. 

mtexdata dubna
odf = calcODF(pf,'resolution',5*degree,'zero_Range')
plot(odf,'sigma')

%%
% In the following we will differentiate whether we approximate $f$ by a 
% |@SO3FunHarmonic| or by a |@SO3FunRBF|.
%
%% Harmonic Approximation
%
% The basic strategy is to approximate the 
% data by a |@SO3FunHarmonic| (Harmonic series), i.e. a series of 
% <WignerFunctions.html Wigner-D functions>, see 
% <SO3FunHarmonicRepresentation.html SO3FunHarmonicSeries Basics of rotational harmonics>. 
% 
% For that, we compute the so-called Fourier coefficients 
% ${\bf \hat f} = (\hat f^{0,0}_0,\dots,\hat f^{N,N}_N)^T$ of 
% 
% $$ f({\bf R}) = \sum_{n=0}^N\sum_{k,l=-n}^n \hat{f}^{k,l}_n \, D_n^{k,l}({\bf R}). $$
%  
% The Fourier coefficients are defined by
%
% $$ \hat f^{k,l}_n = \int_{SO(3)} f({\bf R}) \cdot \overline{D_n^{k,l}({\bf R})} \,\mathrm{d}\mu({\bf R}) $$
% 
% and we compute this integral by numerical integration, which is also 
% called quadrature, i.e.
%
% $$ \hat f^{k,l}_n \approx \sum_{m=1}^M \omega_m \, f({\bf R}_m) \, \overline{D_n^{k,l}({\bf R}_m)} $$
%
% with suitable quadrature weights $\omega_m$ and quadrature nodes
% $\bf{R}_m$, $m=1,\dots,M$.
%
% In MTEX there are two quadrature schemes predefined:
%
% * Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature scheme (default)
% * Gauss-Legendre quadrature scheme
%
% Both of them are defined with respect to some bandwidth $N$ and they are
% exact for all band-limited functions of this specific bandwidth. That
% means, if we perform quadrature on any |@SO3FunHarmonic| of bandwidth N
% with one of this schemes, then we will get exactly this function back.
%
%%
% In MTEX we use the command <SO3FunHarmonic.html |SO3FunHarmonic|> to expand
% any |@SO3Fun| or |@function_handle| into an |@SO3FunHarmonic|.
% 

SO3F = SO3FunHarmonic(odf)
plot(SO3F,'sigma')

%%
% Internally MTEX calls <SO3FunHarmonic.approximate.html
% |SO3FunHarmonic.approximate|>. We can specify the bandwidth of the
% approximated |@SO3FunHarmonic| with the option |'bandwidth'| and we can
% tell MTEX to use the other quadrature scheme.

SO3F2 = SO3FunHarmonic(odf,'bandwidth',10,'GaussLegendre')
plot(SO3F2,'sigma')

%%
% If we do not have an |@SO3Fun| or |@function_handle|, but we try to 
% approximate a function from some physical experiment or more complex 
% Matlab function (where we can put in specific orientations and get out 
% numbers), then we proceed as follows.
%
% One idea could be to perform the experiment for random orientations and
% <SO3FunApproximationTheory interpolate this discrete data> in a second
% step.
%
% But, if we can choose the orientations by our own, we should better 
% choose an optimal/minimal orientation grid, perform the experiment on 
% this grid and compute the Fourier coefficients of the harmonic expansion 
% by quadrature.
%
% This is exactly what happens internally when we call the 
% |SO3FunHarmonic|-command.
% In fact this is a special case of approximation of discrete data for a 
% very specific grid.
%
% In the following, the |EXPERIMENT|-method is something, where we put in
% orientations and obtain corresponding values. That could be a physical 
% experiment or maybe also some computational routine.
%

% Specify the bandwidth and symmetries of the desired harmonic odf
bw = 50;
cs = crystalSymmetry('321');
ss = specimenSymmetry;

% Compute the quadrature grid and weights
CC_grid = quadratureSO3Grid(bw,'ClenshawCurtis',cs,ss);

% Because of symmetries there are symmetric equivalent nodes in the
% quadrature grid. Hence we perform our experiment on a smaller unique
% grid.
ori = CC_grid(:)
v = EXPERIMENT(ori);

% At the end we do quadrature
E1 = SO3FunHarmonic.quadrature(CC_grid,v)
% E1 = SO3FunHarmonic.interpolate(CC_grid,v) % does the same

%%
% Furthermore, if the experimental step is very expansive it might be a
% good idea to use the smaller Gauss-Legendre quadrature grid. The
% Gauss-Legendre quadrature lattice has half as many points as the default
% Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature lattice. But the quadrature method is slightly
% more time consuming.

% Compute the Gauss-Legendre quadrature grid and weights
GL_grid = quadratureSO3Grid(bw,'GaussLegendre',cs,ss);

% Perform the experiment on that quadrature grid
ori = GL_grid(:)
v = EXPERIMENT(ori);

% Do quadrature
E2 = SO3FunHarmonic.quadrature(GL_grid,v)

%%
% Both of this quadrature schemes yield exactly the same |@SO3FunHarmonic|.

%% RBF-Kernel Approximation
%
% The basic strategy is to approximate the given function $f$  
% by a |@SO3FunRBF|, see <RadialODFs.html Radial Basis Functions on SO(3)>. 
%
% Hence we determine rotations $\bf{R}_1,\dots,\bf{R}_N$ and seek the corresponding 
% coefficients $\vec c=(c_1,\dots,c_N)$ such that
%
% $$ g(\bf{x}) = \sum_{n=1}^N c_n \, \Psi(\cos\frac{\omega({\bf{x}},{\bf{R}}_n)}{2}) $$
% 
% approximates $f$ reasonable well, i.e. $f\approx g$. 
% In this formula, $\Psi$ describes a <SO3Kernels.html SO(3)-Kernel 
% Function>. Hence, $f$ is a superposition of one rotational kernel 
% function centered on the orientations $\bf{R}_1,\dots,\bf{R}_N$ and weighted by the 
% coefficients $c_1,\dots,c_N$.
% 
% A basic strategy is to apply least squares approximation, where we 
% compute the coefficients $c_n$ by minimizing the functional 
%
% $$ \sum_{m=1}^M|f({\bf{x}}_m)-g({\bf{x}}_m)|^2 $$
%
% for some specific orientations $\bf{x}_1,\dots,\bf{x}_M$.
%
% This least squares problem can also be written in matrix vector notation
% $ \argmin_{c} \| K \cdot c - v \|, $
% where $x=(c_1,\dots,c_N)^T$, $v=(v_1,\dots,v_M)^T$ and $K$ is the kernel
% matrix $[\Psi(\cos\frac{\omega({\bf{x}}_m,{\bf{R}}_n)}{2})]_{m,n}$.
%
% This least squares problem can be solved by the |lsqr| method from MATLAB,
% which efficiently seeks for roots of the derivative of the given 
% functional (also known as normal equation).
%
% Alternatively there is also a modified least square method |mlsq|, which
% search for a solution $c_1,\dots,c_N$ that satisfies $c>0$ and 
% $\sum_{n=1}^N c_n = 1$. This method can be used if the underlying
% function is a density, i.e. it is nonnegative and has mean 1, which can
% be applied if we try to approximate a density function.
%
%%
% In MTEX we use the command <SO3FunRBF.html |SO3FunRBF|> to represent
% any |@SO3Fun| or |@function_handle| by an |@SO3FunRBF|.
% 
% In the following we want to use this to transform a given 
% |@SO3FunHarmonic| back into a |@SO3FunRBF|.
%

SO3F3 = SO3FunRBF(SO3F,'density')
% SO3F2 = SO3FunRBF.approximate(SO3F,'density')
plot(SO3F3,'sigma')

%%
% Here MTEX internally calls the 
% <SO3FunRBF.approximate.html |SO3FunRBF.approximate|> method.
%
%%
% The flag |'density'| tells MTEX to use the |mlsq| solver, which ensures 
% that the resulting function is nonnegative and normalized to mean $1$.

minValue = min(SO3F3)

meanValue = mean(SO3F3)

%%
% We can specify the kernel of the approximated |@SO3FunRBF| with 
% the option |'kernel'| or |'halfwidth'| and we can use the options 
% |'SO3Grid'| and |'resolution'| to choose some specific set of rotations 
% as centers $\bf{R}_1,\dots,\bf{R}_N$ of the approximation $g$.

SO3F4 = SO3FunRBF(SO3F,'halfwidth',5*degree,'resolution',10*degree)

% If we do not have an |@SO3Fun| or |@function_handle|, but we try to

% Matlab function (where we can put in specific orientations and get out

% an |@equispacedSO3Grid| and <SO3Fun.Approximation approximate this

%
%% RBF-Kernel Approximation by minimizing the harmonic Error
% 
% The basic idea is the same as in the previous section.
% We determine rotations $\bf{R}_1,\dots,\bf{R}_M$ and seek the 
% corresponding coefficients $\vec c=(c_1,\dots,c_N)$ of
%
% $$ g({\bf{x}}) = \sum_{m=1}^M c_m \, \Psi(\cos\frac{\omega({\bf{x}},{\bf{R}}_m)}{2}), $$
%
% such that $g$ approximates $f$ in a certain sense.
% But in what sense exactly? 
%
% In the previous section, we minimized the pointwise error (in spatial 
% domain) between $f$ and $g$ on some grid, i.e. we minimized 
% $ \sum\limits_{m=1}^M|f({\bf{x}}_m)-g({\bf{x}}_m)|^2 $ in $M$ points.
%
% Now we will minimize the error in frequency domain. Hence, the 
% Fourier coefficients of $f$ are supposed to be nearly the same as the 
% Fourier coefficients of $g$. 
%
% So, we will try to determine the coefficients $c_1,\dots,c_M$ such that 
%
% $$ \sum_{n=0}^N \sum_{k,l=-n}^n |\hat f_n^{k,l} - \hat g_n^{k,l}|^2 $$
% 
% is minimized.
%
%%
% In MTEX we call this by adding the option |'harmonic'| to the
% <SO3FunRBF.html |SO3FunRBF|>-command.

%% LSQR-Parameters
%
% The |lsqr| solver and the |mlsq| solver, which are used to minimize the least
% squares problem from above has some predefined termination conditions.
% We can specify the method tolerance with the option |'tol'| 
% (default 1e-3) and the maximum number of iterations by the option 
% |'maxit'| (default 30/100).
%
% Thus we are able to control the precision of the result and computational 
% time of the least squares methods in the approximation process.
