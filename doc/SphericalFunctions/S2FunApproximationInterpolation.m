%% Spherical Approximation and Interpolation
%
%%
% On this page, we want to cover the topic of function approximation from
% discrete values on the sphere. To simulate this, we have stored some
% nodes and corresponding function values which we can load. The csv-file
% contains the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-component of the nodes and the function
% value in the fourth column. Lets import these data using the function
% <vector3d.load.html |load|> 

fname = fullfile(mtexDataPath, 'vector3d', 'smiley.csv');
[nodes, S] = vector3d.load(fname,'columnNames',{'x','y','z','values'});

%%
% The second output |S| is a struct that contains a field |S.values| with
% the function values from the fourth column. Next, we can make a scatter
% plot to see, what we are dealing with

scatter(nodes, S.values, 'upper');

%%
% Now, we want to find a function which coincides with the given function
% values in the nodes reasonably well.

%% Interpolation
%
%%
% The idea of the first approach is fairly simple. We create a function
% which has *exactly* the value of the given data in the nodes. But we
% still have to decide what happens inbetween these nodes. For that, we
% linearly interpolate between them, similarly as Matlat plots a
% one-dimensional function

close all
plot(rand(10,1), '.-','linewidth',2)

%%
% With some mathematics we can lift this concept to the sphere. This is
% done by the <vector3d.interp |interp|> command of the class
% <vector3d.vector3d |vector3d|> when the argument |'linear'| is given
%

sFTri = interp(nodes, S.values, 'linear');

%%
% To see that we realy have the exact function values, we can evaluate
% |sFTri| of type <S2FunTri.S2FunTri |S2FunTri|> and compare it with the
% original data values.

norm(eval(sFTri, nodes) - S.values)

%%
% Indeed, the error is within machine precision.
% Now we can work with the function defined on the whole sphere.
% We can, for instance, plot it

contourf(sFTri, 'upper');

%%
% That does not look like the happy smiley face we had in mind. There are
% other variants to fill the gaps between the data nodes, still preserving
% the interpolation property, which may improve the result. But if we don't
% restrict ourselfs to the given function values in the nodes, we have more
% freedom, which can be seen in the case of approximation.

%% Approximation
%
%%
% In contrast to interpolation we are now not restricted to the function
% values in the nodes but still want to keep the error reasonably small.
% One way to achieve this is to approximate it with a series of spherical
% harmonics. We don't take as many spherical harmonics as there are nodes,
% such that we are in the overdetermined case. In that way we don't have a
% chance of getting the error in the nodes zero but hope for a smoother
% approximation. This can be achieved by the <vector3d.interp |interp|>
% command of the class <vector3d.vector3d |vector3d|> when the argument
% |'harmonicApproximation'|

sF = interp(nodes, S.values, 'harmonicApproximation');
contourf(sF, 'upper');

%%
% Plotting this function, we can immidiately see, that we have a much
% smoother function. But one has to keep in mind that the error in the data
% nodes is not zero as in the case of interpolation.

norm(eval(sF, nodes) - S.values)

%%
% But this may not be of great importance like in the case of function
% approximation from noisy function values, where we don't know the exact
% function values anyways.

%%
%
% The strategy underlying the |interp(...,'harmonicApproximation')|-command
% to obtain such an approximation works via spherical harmonics
% (<S2FunHarmonicRepresentation Basics of spherical harmonics>). For that,
% we seek for so-called Fourier-coefficients ${\bf \hat f} = (\hat
% f_0^0,\dots,\hat f_M^M)^T$ such that
%
% $$ g(x) = \sum_{m=0}^M\sum_{l = -m}^m \hat f_m^l Y_m^l(x) $$
%
% approximates our function. A basic strategy to achieve this is through
% least squares, where we minimize the functional 
%
% $$ \sum_{n=1}^N|f(x_n)-g(x_n)|^2 $$
%
% for the data nodes $x_n$, $n=1,\dots,N$, $f(x_n)$ the target function
% values and $g(x_n)$ our approximation evaluated in the given data nodes.
%
% This can be done by the |lsqr| function of Matlab, which efficiently
% seeks for roots of the derivative of the given functional (also known as
% normal equation). In the process we compute the matrix-vector product
% with the Fourier-matrix multible times, where the Fourier-matrix is given
% by
%
% $$ F = [Y_m^l(x_n)]_{n = 1,\dots,N;m = 0,\dots,M,l = -m,\dots,m}. $$
%
% This matrix-vector product can be computed efficiently with the use of
% the nonequispaced spherical Fourier transform
% <https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/nfft/nfsft.php NFSFT>.
%
% We end up with the Fourier-coefficients of our approximation $g$, which
% describe our approximation.
